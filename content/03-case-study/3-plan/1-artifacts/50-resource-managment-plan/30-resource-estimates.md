# Resource Estimates
– Project PASS PMP  

---

## 📎 Purpose

This file captures the **estimated level of effort (LOE)** required from each team member or resource to complete project tasks.  
It supports:
- The [Cost Estimates](../30-cost-management-plan/40-Cost-Estimates.md)  
- The [Detailed Project Schedule](../20-schedule-management/02-detailed-project-schedule.md)  
- The [Resource Management Plan](10-resource-management-plan.md)

Effort is expressed in hours (or story points if Agile) and matched to the RACI Matrix.
