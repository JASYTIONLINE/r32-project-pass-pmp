# PMI Lore Fidelity Policy  

> [!link]
> **Cross-Reference:**  
> This policy operates in concert with the **[Writer Style Guide — The Last Gate (Lore Door)](pol-tlg-lore-writing-style-guide.md)** and the **[Writer Style Guide — Structured Learning (Information Pages)](pol-writer-style-guide-structured-learning.md)**.  
> All three documents draw from the shared voice of **the Author**, ensuring every page—whether narrative, informational, or metaphorical—sounds like one connected mind.  

---

## 1. Purpose  

This policy ensures that all **sci-fi metaphors, stories, and narrative artifacts** created under Project Mystro respect and reinforce **PMI canon**.  
The goal: a certified PMI instructor should be able to read any Lore Door episode, grin, and say,  
*“That’s ridiculous—but it’s correct.”*  

Lore entertains. Canon instructs. This policy keeps the two holding hands.  

---

## 2. Core Rule  

**Lore may dramatize, but never falsify.**  

Metaphor and humor are encouraged for emotional impact, but the underlying principle must always map to a real PMI concept, process, artifact, or best practice.  
Satire is a coat of paint; PMI truth is the steel underneath.  

---

## 3. Guidelines  

### Canon First  
All section titles, glossary references, and dialogue anchors must use official PMI or Agile Manifesto terminology before any lore embellishment.  

### Metaphor as Skin, Not Skeleton  
The sci-fi dressing (Silent Kings, Granite Thrones, Deep-Space Bureaucrats) adds flavor but can never replace the PMI logic inside.  

### The PMI Inspection Test  
Before finalizing any lore content, ask:  
1. *If a PMI instructor read this, would they agree the concept is represented accurately?*  
2. *If all the jokes and characters disappeared, would the remaining logic still pass an exam prep review?*  

### Reader Experience  
Lore should spark laughter and recognition, never confusion.  
The reader—whether an exam candidate or instructor—should finish a story more certain of PMI’s intent, not less.  

### Glossary Anchoring  
Every PMI-relevant term used in lore must link to its canonical entry in the [[glossary]] for technical accuracy.  

### Structured Learning Alignment  
All informational content in the **Structured Study Guide (100 Series)** must likewise preserve PMI fidelity.  
Those pages deliver the same accuracy through plain-language humor, per the **[Writer Style Guide — Structured Learning](pol-writer-style-guide-structured-learning.md)**.  

### The Author’s Role  
Lore, like all content in this knowledge base, speaks in **the Author’s voice**—that of a sarcastic mentor who finds enlightenment in chaos.  
The Author mocks bureaucracy, never PMI; laughs at human behavior, never the framework.  
Tone unity across lore and learning ensures readers feel a single, trustworthy intelligence guiding them.  

---

## 4. Enforcement  

All contributors (human or GPT) must:  

- Embed glossary links for all PMI terms used in lore or structured content.  
- Preserve canonical terminology in headers and metadata.  
- Validate metaphors against PMI concepts before submission.  
- Reject or flag any text that introduces false definitions, re-orders process flows, or misrepresents a domain.  
- Maintain tonal fidelity to the Author across all sections—sarcasm permitted, inaccuracy forbidden.  

---

## 5. Outcome  

By following this policy:  
- Lore entertains without error.  
- Structured Learning teaches without tedium.  
- The Author’s unified voice bridges satire and scholarship.  

Readers will laugh, nod, and—without realizing it—absorb PMI logic correctly.  
If an instructor can read the lore aloud in class without flinching, this policy has done its job.
