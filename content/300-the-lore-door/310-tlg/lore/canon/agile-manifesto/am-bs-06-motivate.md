# Principle 6 – Story Engine & Structural Backstory

## 🔧 How to Use This Backstory
This doctrine rebukes distance and indirection. Use it to stir contempt for regimes that hide behind memos, proxies, and reports, and admiration for those who meet openly in the square. Anchor it in modern echoes: [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-interactive-communication|Interactive communication]] as the gold standard, embodied in [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-daily-standup|Daily standups]], direct [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-stakeholder-engagement|stakeholder engagement]], and crisp decisions captured in the [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-decision-log|Decision log]].

## 🧠 Principle 6 Backstory (In-World Truth)
The elders speak of the **Era of Sealed Scrolls** (lore). Kings issued edicts by parchment, copied by scribes, carried for days across valleys. By the time the scrolls arrived, the battles had shifted, the markets had turned, the truth had changed. Decisions lagged behind reality, and kingdoms bled from the gap.  

Out of that ruin, a new rhythm emerged: face to face. Markets were rebuilt with councils held in open squares, no walls, no middlemen. Voice to ear, question to answer, adjustment in real time. A conversation was worth more than a thousand scrolls.  

Thus was written the sixth law of the Plan:  

> **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation.**

Communities internalized it as survival. Every project began with gathering circles, not chains of parchment. Even in later eras of machines and data, the doctrine endured: talk directly first, document second.

## 💧 How to Leak the Backstory (Narrative Integration)
- Town murals of kings drowned under piles of unread scrolls.  
- Ritual law in guilds: *“No order lives until it is spoken in person.”*  
- Festivals that reenact the fall of the scroll-king, mocked for hiding behind proxies.  
- Daily huddles in public squares — ancestors of the modern [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-daily-standup|Daily standup]].  
- Governance echoes: mandates that no [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-change-request|change request]] is accepted without a direct walkthrough; a rule stitched into the [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-team-charter|Team charter]].

## 🎯 Key Moment — The Emotional Payoff
The payoff hits when a leader breaks protocol, sets aside parchment, and speaks directly to the people. In that moment, clarity cuts through confusion. Readers feel scorn for the Scroll Kings who drowned in their own distance, and admiration for the simple courage of direct voice. The ideology endures: the fastest path to truth is face to face.
