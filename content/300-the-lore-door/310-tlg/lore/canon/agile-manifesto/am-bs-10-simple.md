# Principle 10 – Story Engine & Structural Backstory

## 🔧 How to Use This Backstory
This doctrine is a weapon against clutter. It reminds leaders that every extra step, every unnecessary [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-deliverable|deliverable]], every bloated [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-scope-baseline|scope baseline]] is weight carried into battle. Readers should feel contempt for over-builders and reverence for those who pare to the bone. Anchor its practice in [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-value-delivery|value delivery]], ruthless [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-prioritization|prioritization]] (create stub), and trimming [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-backlog|backlogs]] until only true [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-business-value|business value]] remains.

## 🧠 Principle 10 Backstory (In-World Truth)
There was once the **Empire of Thousand Gears** (lore). Its rulers believed more meant stronger: more rules, more cogs, more processes. They issued [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-management-plan|management plans]] thick as stone, demanded [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-status-report|status reports]] daily, and flooded their workshops with features no one had asked for.  

At first, the machines gleamed. But the gears jammed on each other. No one could tell which lever mattered. When famine came, no gear was light enough to move quickly. The empire rusted in place.  

From their collapse rose the tenth law of the Plan:  

> **Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential.**

Communities after the fall began building differently. They chose small, clear [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-objective|objectives]] tied to [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-business-value|business value]]. They stopped worshiping busyness and started asking, *“What can we cut?”* The truest strength was revealed not in the clutter of many, but in the clarity of few.

## 💧 How to Leak the Backstory (Narrative Integration)
- Ruined workshops full of broken gears, left untouched as a warning.  
- Proverbs carved in guild halls: *“The sharpest blade is forged by what is struck away.”*  
- Cultural rituals where plans are burned down to essentials before work begins — early echoes of [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-backlog-refinement|backlog refinement]].  
- Tales mocking the “Gearlords” (lore villains) who drowned in their own complexity.  
- Workrooms displaying only a single visible [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-kpi|KPI]] to guide the effort.

## 🎯 Key Moment — The Emotional Payoff
The release lands when someone dares to strike through half a plan — and suddenly, the remainder moves. The crowd sees speed where there was once weight. Readers feel hatred for the Gearlords who built labyrinths and deep admiration for the few who cut paths clear. The ideology embeds: true mastery is not in adding more, but in choosing less.
