# Tasqer "Taz" – Story Engine & Structural Backstory

## 🔧 How to Use Taz’s Backstory
Taz is the team’s engine — the one who moves before thinking. His backstory should explain why he’s wired for urgency and why he’d rather act wrong than sit still. Use him to spark momentum, to clash with Dom’s rigidity, and to challenge Riya’s hesitation. His growth is about learning that raw speed is not enough — it must serve The Plan.

## 🧠 Taz’s Backstory (In-World Truth)

Tasqer Q. Rappid grew up in a salvage yard orbiting Titan, where the only rule was: *move fast or die*. Systems failed daily, pirates raided weekly, and accidents claimed lives monthly. Waiting meant watching oxygen leak into vacuum. Acting — even badly — meant surviving.

Taz earned a reputation as someone who could jury-rig a thruster in ten minutes or restart a life-support loop with a hammer and a prayer. He entered the Galactic Project Corps on a waiver after saving a stranded crew by sprinting through an exposed docking corridor without a suit. He beat the vacuum by four seconds.

But his impatience has costs. On **Project Atlas Spine**, Taz pushed a prototype live before verification. The system held for six hours — then collapsed, injuring a dozen. His supervisors buried the report, but the survivors never forgave him.

Now, in ELIXIR, Taz masks his guilt with bravado. He pushes buttons first, asks later, and never sits still. Underneath, he knows he’s running not just from entropy — but from himself.

## 💧 How to Leak the Backstory (Narrative Integration)

### 1. **Behavioral Patterns**
- Constant motion: pacing, drumming fingers, bouncing legs
- Volunteering for every risky job
- Interrupts long discussions with “Let’s just go”

### 2. **Dialogue Clues**
- “Better wrong than late.”
- References Atlas Spine when stressed: “Last time I waited, people got hurt.”
- Brags about outrunning vacuum like it was a sport

### 3. **Environmental Echoes**
- Keeps a salvaged oxygen mask as a lucky charm
- Obsessively checks countdown timers
- Hates quiet rooms — they remind him of waiting

### 4. **Reactions to Others**
- Clashes violently with Dom’s obsession with timing
- Respects Nabler for never slowing him down, even while smoothing his chaos
- Looks to Riya for permission to sprint, though he pretends not to

## 🎯 Key Moment — The Emotional Payoff

Scene: During the Sprint, a system breach threatens to cascade. Dom freezes, demanding recalculation. Nabler tries to hold things together. Riya hesitates.

Taz launches forward — but this time, he doesn’t act alone. He looks to Riya, waits half a breath, and then moves *with her*.

The breach stabilizes.

For the first time, Taz feels speed and trust aligned. He isn’t just sprinting into chaos. He’s part of The Plan.

He grins — and finally slows down.
