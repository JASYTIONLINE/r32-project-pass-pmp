# Dominique "Dom" – Story Engine & Structural Backstory

## 🔧 How to Use Dom’s Backstory
Dom is not comic relief — he is the *weight* of process discipline. His backstory should inform why he clings to Gantt charts, critical paths, and forecasts like oxygen. Use him to create friction with Riya when she veers adaptive, and to ground the team when chaos overwhelms them. His growth is about learning that structure should serve The Plan, not suffocate it.

## 🧠 Dom’s Backstory (In-World Truth)

Dominique Tasqer was born into a family of orbital auditors, raised to believe that numbers never lie and deviation always kills. As a cadet in the Galactic Project Corps, he excelled at schedule compression drills and once won an award for predicting a reactor repair timeline within six seconds of actual completion.

But his obsession with precision became a liability. On **Project Phoenix Array**, Dom refused to adjust when unexpected resource conflicts emerged. His timeline was flawless — until three teams burned out, quit, or collapsed from overwork. The project delivered “on time” but cost three lives and left Dom ostracized by his peers.

Since then, Dom has doubled down. He believes control prevents tragedy. He forecasts everything, schedules every meeting, and mutters critical-path math under his breath. He joined ELIXIR reluctantly, still haunted by Phoenix Array, desperate to prove that his structure can save lives — even if deep down, he suspects it won’t.

## 💧 How to Leak the Backstory (Narrative Integration)

### 1. **Behavioral Patterns**
- Constantly recalculates timelines aloud
- Reacts harshly when someone “goes off schedule”
- Gets physically anxious when variance exceeds thresholds

### 2. **Dialogue Clues**
- Drops references to Phoenix Array: “Not again… not this time.”
- Corrects others: “That’s not a delay, that’s a regression.”
- Mutters critical-path math like a prayer

### 3. **Environmental Echoes**
- Keeps old Phoenix Array commendation hidden in his locker
- Has wall of sticky notes and micro-schedules around his desk

### 4. **Reactions to Others**
- Clashes with Taz (impulsive chaos)
- Relies on Nabler to smooth friction
- Watches Riya carefully — half hoping she fails, half desperate for her to succeed

## 🎯 Key Moment — The Emotional Payoff

Scene: During the Sprint (The Ordeal), the Gate blocks progress because of incomplete data. Dom panics, demanding they stop until the schedule realigns. The team hesitates.

Riya overrides. Chaos erupts.

Dom freezes — this is Phoenix Array all over again.

But when the dust settles and the system stabilizes, he sees something he’s never witnessed: a project delivered *because* of adaptation, not despite it.

Dom finally breathes.

He deletes the old Phoenix Array commendation.

And for the first time, he lets The Plan guide him — not his schedule.
