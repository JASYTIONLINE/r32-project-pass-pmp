# The Last Gate Canon: Character Backstory Creation Tool  

## Introduction
- This page is a **reference guide**, not story prose.  
- Each entry follows the same model:  
- Characters double as **exam prep tools**: their voices mirror answer types on the PMP exam.  

### How to Use This Page
- Scan a character to see **their role in the saga** and **what exam logic they represent.**  
- Use them as **mnemonics** for spotting PMI exam cues:  
  - Correct characters *sound like glossary cues.*  
  - M.A.C.P.E.A. *sounds PMI-ish but misses context, might not be "Fully" correct, Might be Correct but nothe "Most Correct."*  
  - Obvious distractors *contradict glossary cues outright.*  
- By the end, you‚Äôll be able to **recognize the right answer vs. distractors** instinctively.

## Character-Sheet-Construction-Rules 
Each character backstory must follow this exact structure for consistency and machine-readability.

### Static Rule
- All charachters stay the same, they don't grow or mature. (Except Riya)
- Charachters (except Riya) are stnad ins for parts of the exam
  - a type of question (wrong answer; right answer; almost, but still wrong anser;)
  - the embodyment of  a concept (Domain, task, enabler, scope creep, etc...) 
  - any charachter introduces tot he story must represent a core key to the exam.
  - therefore all chars stay staic in theri development. They reinfoce an idea each time they interact with the tory.
 
### Formatting Rules
- No free-form paragraphs.
- Bullets for all content under headers.
- Short, punchy lines (5‚Äì12 words per bullet).
- Consistent header emojis for quick scanning:

### Elements of Charachter BS sheet (level ###)
1. Characther Name (Archetype)
2. Function within the Story
3. Core Term/Moto
4. Charachter Summarry
5. Personality and tone
6. How to Use
7. Backstory Outline

#### 1. Charachter Name (Archetype) 
- Example: ### Riya Vedanta ‚Äì (Hero-reader surrogate)
- Core Archetypes / Roles (Hero's Journey)
 - The Hero ‚Äì the protagonist who goes on the journey (Riya in your saga).
 - The Mentor ‚Äì wise guide who provides training, advice, or gifts (JASYTI/Jazz).
 - The Ally/Companions ‚Äì loyal supporters who help the hero (Dom, Nabler, Tasker, Taz).
 - The Herald ‚Äì character/event that announces the call to adventure (the Gate / crisis).
 - The Threshold Guardian ‚Äì tests the hero‚Äôs resolve, blocks entry into the new world (GoKnow Gate, bureaucracy).
 - The Trickster ‚Äì brings mischief, points out flaws, disrupts (Taz has shades of this).
 - The Shadow ‚Äì embodiment of the hero‚Äôs darkest fear or flaw (MACPEA as false process perfection).
 - The Shapeshifter ‚Äì appears to change, causes doubt/confusion, tests perception (S.C. Reep with her ‚Äúvisionary‚Äù spin).
 - The Foil / Temptress ‚Äì distracts the hero from the path, offers false comfort (Risque Mangere‚Äôs melodramatic pleas).

#### 2. Function (each charachter must fit into one of the 5 Function Catagories)
 1. Hero-reader surrogate (Riya)
 2. Support (assists the reader see the right answer)  - JASYTI, DOM, Tasker, Nabler
 3. Red Herring (leads the hero stray through bad pmi advice) - M.A.C.P.E.A, Risque Mangere
 4. Agitator - causes the situation the hero must navigate through failure to follow good PM Pracitces - S.C. Creep
 5. Decoration - NO real teaching purpose (just here to advance the story)

##### Exam Cue - Each Charachter delivers their own Exam Cues as part of their Function
  1. "C"  Correct Answer ‚Äì Best Choice
  2. "PX" Plausible but Wrong ‚Äì Second-Best Distractor
  3. "DX" Clearly Incorrect ‚Äì Throw-Away Distractor
  4. "RP" Test Taker ‚Äì Reader Proxy (Riya)
 - *NOTE:* Each chrachter's Role determines what kind of exam cue indicator they will give through their story diaogue through the use of Keywords/phrases linked to glossary cues (e.g., sequencing, tailoring, stakeholder engagement)

#### 3. Core Term and Moto
- Each charachter must embody a only one core TERM (found in the Glossary) in realtion to Project Managment.
- Main Charachters Embody Core Concepts that relate across all areas of PM not just specific process or phases.
- Examples: 
 - J.A.S.I.T.Y (Jazz): Core Term: *Project Integration Management*; Moto: "If we fail to plan, we plan to fail!"
 - Dominique (DOM): Core Term: *Domain*: Moto "People imfluence process; Process influences business; business influences People."
 - Tasker (Tas): Core Term: *Task*; Moto: "What we do next, determines what we do next!"
 - Nabler: Core Term: *Enabler*; Moto: "We must first decide how this process brings value to the Plan"
 - Risk Managment: Core Term: *Risk Managment Plan* (corrupted): Moto: "We will worry about that later, just log it!"
 - Goknow: Core Term: *Decision Making* (corrupted); Moto:"Who needs all the facts when I already have all the answers?‚Äù
 - S.C. Reep: Core Term: *Scope Creep*; Moto: "I have an idea!"

  - Example: ‚ÄúProvides the ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs next‚Äô voice, but not the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô.‚Äù

Note: With these rules, every new character sheet will drop cleanly into the canon, scan the same way, and double as a study aid + story engine.
