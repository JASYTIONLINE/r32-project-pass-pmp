# S.C. Reep â€“ Story Engine & Structural Backstory

## ðŸ”§ How to Use S.C. Reepâ€™s Backstory
S.C. Reep is the **living embodiment of scope creep.** She doesnâ€™t attack with weapons, but with requests, vision decks, and inspirational memos. Her backstory should inform why she believes every addition is improvement, and why she cannot stop herself from asking for "just one more feature." Use her to destabilize Riyaâ€™s progress, overwhelm the crew, and show how unchecked expansion is as dangerous as rigid control.

## ðŸ§  S.C. Reepâ€™s Backstory (In-World Truth)

Synthia Clarion Reep grew up in the corporate academies of the Empire, where ambition was measured by how many projects you could attach your name to. She quickly discovered that executives were rewarded not for delivery, but for *expansion*. If a project added scope, it looked visionary. If it collapsed under the weight of that scope, someone else was blamed.

By the time she was thirty, Reep had built an empire of failed initiatives that nonetheless advanced her career. She perfected the art of the **Innovation Marathon** â€” adding new features faster than teams could deliver old ones, then declaring victory by shifting metrics.

She survived the fall of the Empire by pivoting her language: "alignment," "synergy," "growth opportunities." Always more, never less. M.A.C.P.E.A. tolerated her because her noise masked its rigidity â€” entropy and control feeding each other.

Now, aboard Platform 7, she has her sights on Project ELIXIR. She insists it must be more than stabilization â€” it must also predict user sentiment, support cross-colony languages, and look less blue. Every demand she makes destabilizes the project, but she doesnâ€™t see sabotage. She sees legacy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Moment â€” The Emotional Payoff

Scene: In the final Sprint, with systems collapsing, S.C. Reep arrives demanding a "last-minute pivot" to add predictive analytics to the launch. The team stares at her in disbelief.

Riya steps forward.

> Riya: "No. The Plan isnâ€™t everything you want. Itâ€™s everything we need."

Reep laughs, dismissive â€” until the Gate rejects her request outright. For the first time, her power evaporates.

She stares as the override proceeds without her.

Scope Creep is finally cut off.

And in that silence, Riya proves that restraint is as powerful as ambition.
