# Principle 1 ‚Äì Story Engine & Structural Backstory

## üîß How to Use This Backstory
Aim this doctrine at the habit of hoarding work ‚Äúuntil it‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù It should make readers allergic to long, silent waits and loyal to **rhythm**: short **timeboxed** drops of value ([[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-timebox|Timebox]]), visible **increments** ([[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-incremental-delivery|Incremental delivery]]), and constant proof that the team is listening to the [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-stakeholder|Stakeholder]] heartbeat. Tie the myth to live mechanics: trimmed scope toward an early [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-mvp|Minimum Viable Product (MVP)]], a pruned [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-product-backlog|Product backlog]], posted intent on an [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-information-radiator|Information radiator]], and frequent review against [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-acceptance-criteria|Acceptance criteria]] and a clear [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-definition-of-done|Definition of Done]] (create stub if missing).

## üß† Principle 1 Backstory (In-World Truth)
They called them the **Silent Kings** (lore). Cloaked in mirrors and marble, they drew palaces in the air and swore to unveil them ‚Äúwhen perfection dawns.‚Äù Couriers carried scrolls of intent through thirsty streets; no water came.

The drought was not only in wells but in trust. Markets stalled. Families learned to stop believing. The Kings kept polishing their blueprints until the day **no one waited anymore**.

From that ruin, elders carved a rule into the city‚Äôs stone steps:

> **A shard in hand is worth a crown in dreams.**  
> Deliver early. Deliver often. Keep the promise small but alive.

So the Plan‚Äôs first law took root: **satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable work.** Not speeches‚Äî**drops**. Not someday‚Äî**now, again, and again.**

How it lives in practice:
- Scope thinned to a usable **first slice** (aim at an early [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-mvp|MVP]]) that meets real [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-acceptance-criteria|Acceptance criteria]] and can be **formally accepted** via [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-validate-scope|Validate Scope]].  
- Work arranged for flow; near-term items refined, far-term light ‚Äî a breathing [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-product-backlog|Product backlog]].  
- Cadence chosen (iteration or flow) and protected ‚Äî weekly/biweekly drops or continuous drip; either way, value appears on a schedule (use [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-release-planning|Release planning]] to shape the arc).  
- Every drop is a **[[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-deliverable|Deliverable]]** the customer can touch, question, accept, or redirect toward **[[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-value-delivery|Value delivery]]** and long-haul [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-benefits-realization|Benefits realization]] (create stub if missing).

The city that replaced the Kings learned a different pride: **show, don‚Äôt swear**. Bakers put small loaves on the sill before dawn. Mechanics posted which valves were fixed and which were next. Builders chalked each day‚Äôs progress in public squares (old-world [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-information-radiator|Information radiator]]). Trust became **evidence**, not **hope**.

## üíß How to Leak the Backstory (Narrative Integration)
- Morning ritual: ring the cadence bell, post the day‚Äôs **increment** and the **next two** queued items (flowing from the [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-product-backlog|Product backlog]]).  
- Market rule: nothing is ‚Äúdone‚Äù until it meets the posted [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-definition-of-done|Definition of Done]] and the customer‚Äôs [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-acceptance-criteria|Acceptance criteria]]; then log acceptance (feeds [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-validate-scope|Validate Scope]]).  
- Street proverb: *‚ÄúCount drops, not speeches.‚Äù* Citizens point to the wall board instead of listening to promises (culture of [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-value-delivery|Value delivery]]).  
- Festival of Shards: each guild displays its smallest, realest win of the year ‚Äî an ode to the first usable slice ([[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-mvp|MVP]]) and the courage to ship.

## üéØ Key Moment ‚Äî The Emotional Payoff
The turn hits when a thirsty crowd receives **something**‚Äîa tap that works, a lantern that lights‚Äî**before** the masterpiece is complete. The crowd exhales. Faith returns. Not because the final palace arrived, but because **today‚Äôs drop** did. Readers should walk away with mild contempt for the **Silent Kings** and fierce loyalty to makers who **ship small, ship soon, ship again**.
