# Principle 2 ‚Äì Story Engine & Structural Backstory

## üîß How to Use This Backstory
This doctrine is invoked whenever rigidity masquerades as strength. It warns  
against leaders who clutch [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-scope-baseline|scope baselines]] as if they were sacred,  
who treat every [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-requirements|requirement]] as stone, and who block late [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-change-request|change requests]]  
for fear of embarrassment rather than in service of value.  
Readers should come away admiring the flexible, scorning the brittle.

## üß† Principle 2 Backstory (In-World Truth)
The ancients tell of the **Stone Era** [stub: lore], when kings carved their decrees into granite,  
believing permanence was power. Walls soared; codes were etched into marble.  
They boasted that their reign was immune to [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-risk|risk]],  
that no [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-stakeholder|stakeholder]] could sway what was written.  

But the seas rose. Winds shifted. Crops failed. The kings refused to adapt.  
‚ÄúNothing changes,‚Äù they cried, clutching stone tablets.  
When the tides came, the walls cracked. The Granite Thrones [stub: lore]  
became tombs of arrogance.  

The survivors carried forward a new law of the Plan:  

> **To resist is to break; to bend is to endure.**  

Change, even in the final hour, is not betrayal ‚Äî it is survival.  
Adaptive planning was born from those ashes: short loops,  
rolling adjustments, and courage to re-align the [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-backlog|backlog]]  
when the world demanded it.

## üíß How to Leak the Backstory (Narrative Integration)
- Ruins of shattered tablets, a proverb etched by descendants:  
  *‚ÄúStone sinks; wood floats.‚Äù* [stub: lore proverb]  
- Civic ritual: when storms threaten, markets redraw their [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-roadmap|roadmaps]] [stub] overnight.  
- Festivals mocking the Granite Thrones ‚Äî actors play kings who drown rather than shift.  
- Governance echoes: no [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-change-log|change log]] accepted without an accompanying  
impact analysis of value. No [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-project-management-plan|Project Management Plan]] considered complete  
until its adaptability is tested.

## üéØ Key Moment ‚Äî The Emotional Payoff
The emotional release comes when someone, faced with collapse,  
dares to bend instead of break. The reader feels contempt for the drowned kings  
and awe for the survivors who chose motion over marble.  
The ideology crystallizes: change is not weakness.  
It is obedience to the Plan itself.
