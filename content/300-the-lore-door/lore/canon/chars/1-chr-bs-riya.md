#### Riya's Backstory (In-World Truth)

Riya Vedanta was once a rising star in interstellar systems delivery. She was a certified master of procedural governance, fluent in PMBOK 6, and known for executing flawlessly within fixed scope, timeline, and budget. 

Then came **Project GOATSTREAM** — a well-documented disaster now used as a cautionary tale in PM onboarding.

GOATSTREAM was meant to deliver neural comfort loops to deep-space miners using ambient goat bleats. It followed every PMBOK 6 standard: triple-phase risk review, locked scope, stakeholder matrix, air-tight compliance.
- And it failed spectacularly.
- A solar flare disrupted the signal. The audio over-amplified. The goats panicked.
- **Then the goats exploded.**
- The Gate had said GO. She had followed the book.
- Afterward, miners in Sector 9 reported weeks of auditory hallucinations. The only reason she wasn’t spaced was the amount of documentation she’d filed.
- She wasn’t officially fired. She was buried — reassigned to back-end monitoring, forgotten by leadership, and, over time, by herself.

When we meet her, she’s surviving on caffeine and apathy, quietly rotting in her own reputation. But the Plan — the real Plan — still flickers beneath the surface. She can feel it. She just doesn’t believe she deserves to touch it.

#### How to Use Riya’s Backstory
Riya’s backstory is not a flashback, info dump, or exposition wall. It is a **narrative pressure system** — a buried emotional logic that guides every choice, every hesitation, and every override.

Her past doesn’t interrupt the story — it **drives it**.

The reader comes to understand her piece by piece, through:
- Her reactions to failure and authority
- The decisions she doesn’t make
- The people she avoids
- The sarcasm that cracks under pressure

The story works **because** she’s hiding something.
It lands **because** she finally stops.

#### How to Leak the Backstory (Narrative Integration)

##### 1. **Behavioral Clues**
- Overly rigid with process, even when it hurts
- Over-corrects: logs too much, escalates too quickly, avoids ownership
- Flinches at terms like “launch,” “go-live,” “alignment,” or “bleats”

##### 2. **Dialogue Friction**
- Dom or Taz mention GOATSTREAM in a joke
- She deflects, or her response is too intense for the moment
- Nabler tries to ask seriously — she shuts it down

##### 3. **Environmental Echoes**
- A “goatstream” meme playing in the breakroom
- Hallways that resemble the launch tube from the incident
- A minor system alert with the same tone as the failure warning that didn’t work

##### 4. **Systemic Callbacks**
- Risk Register references a procedure ID that matches GOATSTREAM
- JASYTI notes her past override hesitation and pattern deviation
- The Gate outputs an eerily familiar logic tree

##### 5. **She Tries to Tell the Story — and Can’t**
- Someone asks
- She starts
- Then stops
- “It was... just bad goats. Forget it.”

#### Key Moment — The Emotional Payoff
- Scene: After the Sprint. System stabilized. Her team is alive. The override worked.
- Riya stands in the control hub, alone with JASYTI.
	-  Riya: "It wasn’t just bad goats. It was me. I let the system decide because I didn’t want to be wrong again. And it was wrong."
	- JASYTI doesn’t reply. He simply leaves the channel open.
	- Riya (softly): “This time… I made the call.”
- And for the first time, she feels The Plan flow through her — not as process, but as trust.
- She doesn’t need the Gate to blink.
- She already knows.

#### **Relationships**
- M.A.C.P.E.A. is the corporate compliance ai. It is Riya's only friend (if you could call it that)
  - She once believed implicity in MACPEA but has started to doubt his reliance.  Things he says just don't add up.
