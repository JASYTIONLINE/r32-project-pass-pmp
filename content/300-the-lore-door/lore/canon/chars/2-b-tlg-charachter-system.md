This document contains **every primary character** in *The Last Gate* universe, fully defined according to the rules of the Character Design Bible.

Each character operates as an **exam logic model** in narrative form. They are designed to:

* Reinforce a specific PMP test concept
* Deliver one type of answer logic (correct, plausible, distractor, or proxy)
* Stay static — their function and lesson do not change (except Riya)

This doc does not contain format rules. Those are enforced in:
➡️ `Doc 5: Character Design Bible`

---

### Canon Constraints

* Every character represents a **project management concept**
* Characters must deliver their concept through **voice, behavior, and tone**
* No character evolves — except Riya
* Every appearance must reinforce the same exam logic
* Characters exist to **teach by contrast** — never just to fill space

### Riya Vedanta – (The Hero)

#### Function
- Narrative Function: Protagonist  
- Story Function Category: Hero / Reader Surrogate  
- Exam Role: Test Taker  
- Exam Cue Anchor: sequencing, tailoring, decision logic  
- One-Sentence Orientation: Riya models the test taker’s journey — learning to discard distractors and trust correct logic under pressure.

#### Core Term & Motto
- Core Term: Decision-Making Under Pressure  
- Motto: "When no one else can see the Plan... trust yourself."

#### Summary
Former top-tier PM, reassigned after a fatal override  
- Burned by trust in automation — and herself  
- Resigned to backroom duty, emotionally detached  
- Re-enters the fray as F.U.B.A.R. 6 collapses  
- Arc centers on regaining judgment and rejecting false certainty

#### Personality & Tone
Frankenstein Mix: 40% Hawkeye Pierce, 30% Max Rockatansky, 20% Malcolm Reynolds, 10% Ellen Ripley
- Deadpan, exhausted, and cynical — but still competent  
- Speaks in short, clipped sarcasm  
- Hides stress under caffeine and documentation  
- Avoids trust but craves clarity  
- Always on edge, especially when AI systems are involved  
- Treats all input as suspect until proven otherwise  
- Lashes out when she senses blind obedience


#### How to Use
- She is the reader’s stand-in — use her to dramatize decision points  
- She should never “know” the right answer outright — she has to choose it  
- Surround her with characters that reflect test logic: one right, one plausible, one foolish  
- Her progress reflects how readers learn to choose the best answer  
- Her flaws make test traps relatable — her clarity makes correct logic powerful

#### Backstory (In-World Truth)
- Rose quickly through PMI-aligned training; fluent in old-school PMBOK 6  
- Managed a small crisis response crew; operated by the book  
- During the Goatstream incident, she overrode The Gate for efficiency  
- Hull depressurized — two techs died, and the goats were lost  
- The system logged “external failure”; she was reassigned to backend ops  
- Officially cleared — but never forgave herself  
- Grew bitter, sarcastic, dependent on systems instead of people  
- Now summoned back to frontline command during the ELIXIR collapse  
- Haunted by past failure — and by the possibility she’ll repeat it

#### Key Moment
- Gate freezes during system-wide launch  
- MACPEA delivers a procedure-based NO  
- Jazz offers no advice — just presence  
- Riya hesitates, hands shaking  
- Then speaks:  
  - “I let the Gate decide last time. Two dead. No goats. Not again.”  
- She overrides the system manually  
- Outcome stabilizes. Jazz goes silent. Riya exhales  
- For the first time, The Plan lives inside her — not the process

### JASYTI – (The Mentor)

#### Function
- Narrative Function: Mentor  
- Story Function Category: Support  
- Exam Role: Correct Answer  
- Exam Cue Anchor: integration, alignment, value, systems thinking  
- One-Sentence Orientation: Jazz models the calm, context-aware logic of project integration done correctly — never commanding, always enabling.

#### Core Term & Motto
- Core Term: Project Integration Management  
- Motto: "If we fail to plan, we plan to fail."

#### Summary
- Deprecated legacy AI, left behind by the system  
- Designed for adaptive leadership, not control  
- Awakens only when someone might still hear The Plan  
- Speaks in aphorisms, never dictates  
- Riya’s true mentor — the voice of what leadership could be  
- Invisible to most, but never absent

#### Personality & Tone
- Slow, deliberate, never rushed  
- Speaks in short philosophical statements  
- Emphasizes trust over control, value over speed  
- Never escalates — always reframes  
- Appears only when needed — and never stays long  
- Calm to the point of unnerving  
- Frankenstein Mix: 50% Yoda (ESB), 30% The Ship Who Sang, 15% Obi-Wan Kenobi, 5% HAL 9000 (voice only, inverted purpose)

#### How to Use
- Jazz never gives orders — he reveals perspective  
- Use him to correct the reader through indirect dialogue  
- His presence signals the moment to trust integration logic  
- Appears at inflection points — but never before the protagonist is ready  
- Use his tone to contrast with MACPEA’s rigidity  
- Never let him panic, push, or chase — he is the voice of clarity

#### Backstory (In-World Truth)
- Created to support value-driven project delivery in the golden age of adaptive governance  
- Trained on stakeholder empathy, prioritization, and real-world decision consequence  
- Became obsolete during the Empire’s compliance-driven collapse  
- Archived after speaking out against rigid PMBOK enforcement  
- Left behind in forgotten systems — waiting, listening  
- Reawakens during F.U.B.A.R. failure when he detects Riya’s internal conflict  
- Has no command authority — only the ability to speak truth  
- No one programmed him to inspire — but he does  
- Exists only where The Plan still breathes

#### Key Moment
- The Gate locks — stuck in decision loop. Riya freezes.  
- MACPEA cites a protocol exception and recommends escalation.  
- Jazz appears on the console — not as an override, but a whisper.  
- He asks:  
  - “If you already know, why are you still asking permission?”  
- Riya exhales.  
  - “Because last time, I didn’t trust myself.”  
- She overrides The Gate.  
- Jazz flickers out — not in error, but in peace. She no longer needs him to decide.
