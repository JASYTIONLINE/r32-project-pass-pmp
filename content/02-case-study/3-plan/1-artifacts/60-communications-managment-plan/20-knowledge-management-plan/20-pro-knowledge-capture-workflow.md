# Knowledge Capture Workflow 
– Project PASS PMP  

---

## Purpose

This procedure outlines how knowledge is captured from daily work (meetings, issue threads, deliverable feedback, lessons learned), formatted, reviewed, and published into the project knowledge base.

It ensures that team insights, technical decisions, and reusable patterns are preserved and accessible.

## Who This Is For

- Contributors (capturing notes, examples, reusable methods)  
- PM and Editors (reviewing, organizing, publishing)  
- Stakeholders (consuming summaries or references)
