# Continuous Improvement Plan  
**Project PASS PMP**

---

## 1. Purpose  

The purpose of this **Continuous Improvement Plan (CIP)** is to formalize how the **Project PASS PMP** teaching website captures lessons learned, evaluates performance data, and implements process improvements across all phases of project delivery and content publication.

This plan turns feedback and data into decisions — ensuring that every version of the site, every page, and every learner experience is better than the last.

> **PMI Principle Alignment:**  
> Continuous improvement supports *“Build Quality into Processes”* (PMBOK 7) and ECO **Domain 3 – Business Environment**.

---

## 2. Improvement Philosophy  

Continuous improvement is not an audit task — it’s a mindset.  
Our philosophy rests on four beliefs:

1. **Every outcome is a data point.**  
   Wins and failures both teach.  
2. **Learning never stops.**  
   Improvement is a permanent workstream, not a closing activity.  
3. **Feedback is a gift.**  
   Constructive input from learners and peers drives value.  
4. **Small changes compound.**  
   Weekly adjustments prevent quarterly crises.  

> **Goal:** Deliver sustained excellence through reflection, refinement, and repetition.

## 3. Improvement Framework — *Plan → Do → Check → Act (PDCA)*  

| Phase | Description | Key Actions | Responsible Party |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Plan** | Identify gaps or improvement opportunities based on metrics, reports, and feedback. | - Review quality reports and learner surveys.<br>- Analyze process efficiency.<br>- Define SMART improvement goals. | Project Manager / QA Lead |
| **Do** | Implement pilot improvements or corrective actions. | - Apply revisions to templates or checklists.<br>- Update Writers Room policies if needed.<br>- Test process changes in small batches. | Writers Room / Editors / QA |
| **Check** | Evaluate the effectiveness of changes. | - Monitor updated metrics and learner analytics.<br>- Conduct retrospective meetings.<br>- Document results in the Lessons Learned Register. | QA / Learning Analyst |
| **Act** | Institutionalize improvements across the organization. | - Update official policies, plans, and templates.<br>- Share best practices with all contributors.<br>- Close out improvement cycle with summary report. | Project Manager / Governance Team |

This PDCA loop repeats continuously — every sprint, every release, every update.

## 4. Inputs and Data Sources  

| Source | Data Type | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Quality Reports (43)** | Quantitative | Performance metrics and QC outcomes. |
| **Learner Feedback** | Qualitative | Survey and comment data assessing comprehension and engagement. |
| **YAML Linter / Link Sweeps** | Automated | Error reports on metadata and navigation integrity. |
| **SME Reviews** | Qualitative | Accuracy and relevance checks against PMI standards. |
| **Analytics Dashboard** | Quantitative | Site performance, time-on-page, and return visits. |
| **Retrospectives** | Mixed | Team discussions capturing operational improvement ideas. |

All data sources feed into the **Quality Register**, maintained under `/500-resources/`.

---

## 5. Evaluation Metrics  

Improvement success is measured by comparing before-and-after performance across each cycle.

| Metric | Target | Frequency | Owner |
|--------|---------|------------|-------|
| **Defect Reduction Rate** | ≥ 10% decrease per quarter | Quarterly | Technical QA |
| **Learner Satisfaction Index** | ≥ 90% satisfaction | Quarterly | Learning Analyst |
| **Policy Update Adoption** | 100% within 30 days of approval | Monthly | Writers Room Lead |
| **Turnaround Time for Corrections** | ≤ 7 days average | Continuous | PM / Editors |
| **Continuous Improvement Initiatives Closed** | ≥ 1 implemented per quarter | Quarterly | PM |

---

## 6. Implementation Roadmap  

1. **Gather Insights**  
   - Pull metrics from Quality Reports, analytics, and feedback forms.  
   - Summarize trends and anomalies.

2. **Prioritize Opportunities**  
   - Classify improvement ideas using impact vs. effort matrix.  
   - Select top priorities for the next cycle.

3. **Document Change Requests**  
   - Log new improvement actions in the Change Register.  
   - Define success criteria before execution.

4. **Execute Pilot Improvements**  
   - Test policy, process, or technical changes on a small scale.  
   - Collect short-term results and feedback.

5. **Review and Institutionalize**  
   - Evaluate pilot outcomes.  
   - Approve and scale improvements that deliver measurable benefits.

## 7. Roles & Responsibilities  

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Project Manager** | Leads continuous improvement meetings; ensures actions align with project objectives. |
| **QA Lead** | Tracks implementation of process updates and verifies their impact. |
| **Writers Room Governance Team** | Revises style guides, templates, or policies to embed improvements. |
| **Technical QA** | Executes automated tests to validate changes. |
| **Editors & Contributors** | Provide qualitative feedback during each improvement cycle. |
| **Learners / Stakeholders** | Offer direct feedback on usability, comprehension, and satisfaction. |

---

## 8. Communication and Reporting  

- **Monthly Quality Review:**  
  Consolidates quality metrics and highlights potential improvement actions.  
- **Quarterly Retrospective:**  
  Focuses on root cause analysis and defines new improvement objectives.  
- **Continuous Improvement Register:**  
  Tracks all improvement actions, owners, due dates, and completion status.  
- **Annual Quality Review:**  
  Evaluates strategic progress and informs next year’s project plan revisions.

Reports are stored in the `/10-project-management-plan/40-quality-management-plan/` directory and cross-linked to `43-quality-reports.md`.

## 9. Integration Points  

| Linked Plan | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|
| **Quality Management Plan (40)** | Provides framework and triggers for improvement actions. |
| **Quality Reports (43)** | Supplies evidence and performance data. |
| **Risk Management Plan** | Identifies systemic risks requiring corrective actions. |
| **Writers Room Policies** | Implements content-level refinements post-review. |
| **Communications Management Plan** | Ensures improvement findings are shared with stakeholders. |

---

## 10. Lessons Learned Cycle  

Each improvement cycle concludes with a **Lessons Learned Summary**, including:  
- What worked well.  
- What didn’t work as planned.  
- Root cause analysis.  
- Actions to sustain improvement.  
- Follow-up schedule.

Lessons are cataloged in the **Lessons Learned Register** under `/500-resources/`.
