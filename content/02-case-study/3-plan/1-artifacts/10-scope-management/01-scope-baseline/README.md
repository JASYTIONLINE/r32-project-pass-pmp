# Scope Baseline ‚Äì Overview

Welcome to the **Scope Baseline** folder for **Project PASS PMP**. This folder contains the three core documents that officially define the boundaries, deliverables, and structure of the project.

These artifacts are **locked after approval** and serve as reference points for:
- What will be built
- What is out of scope
- How the work is broken down and tracked

---

## üìÑ What's Inside

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01-project-scope-statement.md` | The high-level definition of the project scope, objectives, deliverables, exclusions, and success criteria. |
| `02-work-breakdown-structure.md` | A visual and hierarchical structure of all project work. Each node corresponds to a major deliverable or group of tasks. |
| `03-wbs-dictionary.md` | A detailed reference that describes each WBS element, its outputs, owners, and dependencies. |

---

## üìå Important Notes

- This folder defines the **approved scope baseline**.
- These documents must not be altered without a **formal Change Request (CR)**.
- All references to project scope, task ownership, and deliverable alignment should start here.

For technical or supporting documents related to how scope is managed (like the Requirements Management Plan or RTM), refer to the `/requirements/` folder in `10-scope-management`.

üîÅ If you need to propose a change to any of these files, please use the official [Change Request Template](../../00-project-integration-management/change-management/change-request-template.md) and submit it through the governance workflow.
