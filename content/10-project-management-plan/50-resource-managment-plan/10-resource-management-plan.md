# 👥 Resource Management Plan – Project PASS PMP  
**Folder:** `/50-resource-management-plan/`  

---

## 📎 Purpose

This plan defines how **human and physical resources** will be:
- Identified
- Assigned
- Managed
- Developed
- Released

It ensures that all project contributors understand their roles, availability, and responsibilities — and that capacity aligns with cost and schedule baselines.

---

## 🧩 Resource Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Human | Project team members, subject matter experts | Sponsor, PM, Developers |
| Physical | Non-human assets required for project execution | GitHub, Obsidian, Quartz publishing tools |

---

## 👤 Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Sponsor | Approves team assignments, validates team structure |
| Project Manager | Maintains RACI, resolves conflicts, monitors performance |
| Contributors | Deliver work as scheduled, track effort, raise blockers |
| Reviewers | Perform audits, review deliverables, give feedback |

Full responsibility matrix available in the [RACI Matrix](20-raci-matrix.md).

## 📊 Resource Estimation and Planning

- Estimations are based on [Resource Estimates](30-resource-estimates.md)  
- Resource hours are synced with the [Cost Estimates](../30-cost-management-plan/40-Cost-Estimates.md)  
- Time-phase data is also reflected in [Resource Calendars](40-resource-calendars.md)

---

## 🗓 Resource Availability

Availability is managed through:
- Team-submitted hours
- Sprint or phase alignment
- Calendar constraints documented in [Resource Calendars](40-resource-calendars.md)

Conflicts are resolved by the PM and tracked using the [Team Charter](50-team-charter.md).

---

## 🎯 Team Development and Training

Any required skill gaps or onboarding needs will be defined in the [Training Plan](60-training-plan.md).  
Common training areas include:
- Markdown publishing
- Quartz/Obsidian configuration
- EVM reporting interpretation

---

## 🚨 Conflict and Performance Resolution

- Conflicts are handled first at the PM level  
- Escalations go to the Sponsor  
- Underperformance or burnout will trigger a team retrospective or a documented reset in the [Team Charter](50-team-charter.md)

---

## ✅ Resource Release Plan

Resources will be released at:
- Milestone completion (see: [Milestone List](../20-schedule-management/03-milestone-list.md))
- Final publishing of content sections
- Closeout of the project

Release planning is aligned with [Funding Requirements](../30-cost-management-plan/60-Funding-Requirements.md) and team agreements.
