# Resource Management
â€“ Document Index  
**Folder:** `/50-resource-management-plan/`

---

## Why This Folder Exists

This folder defines the team structure, availability, effort planning, responsibilities, and norms for Project PASS PMP. Itâ€™s where we plan, assign, support, and manage the people who do the work.

Use these files to answer questions like:

- Who is responsible for what?
- How many hours were estimated?
- When is each person available?
- What are the teamâ€™s working agreements?
- Do we need onboarding or training?

This isnâ€™t just resource tracking â€” this is where delivery capability is defined and sustained.

## Core Documents

### ðŸ“„ [Resource Management Plan](10-resource-management-plan.md)  
Explains how team members and physical resources are identified, assigned, tracked, and released. This is the operational playbook for managing effort and capacity.

### ðŸ“„ [RACI Matrix](20-raci-matrix.md)  
Clarifies who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each key deliverable or process. Use it to avoid duplication, confusion, or missed ownership.

### ðŸ“„ [Resource Estimates](30-resource-estimates.md)  
Breaks down the number of hours estimated per resource per task. Directly tied to cost estimates and used to assess workload balance.

### ðŸ“„ [Resource Calendars](40-resource-calendars.md)  
Defines when people are available to work on the project â€” by week, sprint, or milestone. Includes constraints and capacity notes.

### ðŸ“„ [Team Charter](50-team-charter.md)  
Describes how the team works together: communication norms, values, conflict resolution process, and contributor expectations.

### ðŸ“„ [Training Plan](60-training-plan.md)  
Identifies required onboarding, skill gaps, and learning needed to support successful delivery. Includes roles, topics, and training formats.
