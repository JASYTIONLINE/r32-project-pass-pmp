**Folder:** `/50-resource-management-plan/`

## Why This Folder Exists

This folder defines the team structure, availability, effort planning, responsibilities, and norms for Project PASS PMP. Itâ€™s where we plan, assign, support, and manage the people who do the work.

Use these files to answer questions like:

- Who is responsible for what?
- How many hours were estimated?
- When is each person available?
- What are the teamâ€™s working agreements?
- Do we need onboarding or training?

This isnâ€™t just resource tracking â€” this is where delivery capability is defined and sustained.

## Core Documents

### ðŸ“„ [Resource Management Plan](10-resource-management-plan.md)

### ðŸ“„ [RACI Matrix](20-raci-matrix.md)  
Clarifies who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each key deliverable or process. Use it to avoid duplication, confusion, or missed ownership.

Defines when people are available to work on the project â€” by week, sprint, or milestone. Includes constraints and capacity notes.

### ðŸ“„ [Team Charter](50-team-charter.md)  
Describes how the team works together: communication norms, values, conflict resolution process, and contributor expectations.

### ðŸ“„ [Training Plan](60-training-plan.md)
