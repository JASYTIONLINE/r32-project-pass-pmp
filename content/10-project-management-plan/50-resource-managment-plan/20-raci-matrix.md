# RACI Matrix
 – Project PASS PMP  

---

## 📎 Purpose

This matrix defines **who does what** across major deliverables and management processes.  
The RACI model clarifies the distinction between:
- **R** – Responsible: Performs the task or activity  
- **A** – Accountable: Owns the outcome and approves completion  
- **C** – Consulted: Provides input or subject matter expertise  
- **I** – Informed: Receives updates or notifications  

This helps prevent confusion, overlapping roles, and missed accountability checkpoints.

## 🧩 Interpretation Guidance

- **Accountability Rule:** Only one “A” per task  
- **Responsibility Rule:** Multiple “R”s may exist but must coordinate with the “A”  
- **Consulted:** Brings expertise — they are *engaged before decisions*  
- **Informed:** Receives updates — they are *not decision-makers*
