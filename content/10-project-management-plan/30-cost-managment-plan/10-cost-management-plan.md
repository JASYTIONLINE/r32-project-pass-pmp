# 💰 Cost Management Plan – Project PASS PMP  
**Folder:** `/30-cost-management/`  
**Bloom’s Level:** 2 – Understanding (Describe, Apply, Interpret)

---

## 1. Purpose

This plan defines how costs will be:
- Estimated
- Budgeted
- Baseline-locked
- Controlled
- Reported

It ensures financial discipline, supports budget approval, and defines cost control processes throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## 2. Cost Estimation Approach

Cost estimates will be based on:
- Bottom-up estimation of tasks in the [Detailed Schedule](../20-schedule-management/02-detailed-project-schedule.md)
- Historical benchmarks from past study builds
- Expert judgment from sponsor and content creators

Cost estimates are documented in the [Cost Estimates](./Cost-Estimates.md) file.

---

## 3. Budgeting and Baseline

Once estimates are complete, they are aggregated and phased into the [Cost Baseline](./Cost-Baseline.md).  
This baseline is:
- Time-phased
- Approved by the sponsor
- Locked unless a formal [Change Request](../00-project-integration-management/change-management/change-request-template.md) is submitted

---

## 4. Funding Requirements

Funding needs are documented in [Funding Requirements](./Funding-Requirements.md).  
This includes:
- Contributor hours and stipends
- Tech stack or hosting costs
- Estimated cost buffers for delays or rework

---

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role            | Responsibility                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Sponsor         | Approves cost baseline and funding gates |
| Project Manager | Maintains cost baseline, tracks variance |
| Contributors    | Log time spent, provide effort estimates |
| Finance Reviewer (optional) | Validates major changes |

---

## 6. Cost Control and Variance Management

Cost performance is measured using:
- **Cost Variance (CV)** = EV − AC  
- **Cost Performance Index (CPI)** = EV ÷ AC

Variances greater than ±10% must be escalated and logged via the [Change Request Template](../00-project-integration-management/change-management/change-request-template.md).

---

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- No paid contractors involved unless sponsor-approved
- Sponsor’s time is considered “no-cost” but tracked for realism
- All contributors are part-time and self-paced

### Constraints
- Total hours capped at [insert value]
- No third-party integrations or licensing beyond current toolset

---

## 8. Cost Reporting

Updates are included in the [Schedule Performance Report](../20-schedule-management/05-schedule-performance-report.md), with summaries of:
- CPI trends
- Burn rate (effort vs. timeline)
- Budget-at-completion

---

## 9. Approval

| Name     | Role             | Signature | Date       |
|----------|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Sponsor  | Budget Authority |           |            |
| PM       | Cost Owner       |           |            |

> 📌 This plan governs all cost-related activities in Project PASS PMP. No cost changes or increases to the baseline may be made without formal change control.
