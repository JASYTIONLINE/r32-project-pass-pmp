## 🧭 Why This Folder Matters

Welcome to the **financial control center** of Project PASS PMP.

This folder doesn't just "track the budget" — it shows **how professional project managers estimate, lock, report, and govern every dollar** of a project. It’s designed to teach PMP candidates, new contributors, and project teams how PMI-based cost management works — not just in theory, but in *clickable, usable files*.

> 📌 Use this folder to understand the entire flow of project cost control:
**Estimate → Baseline → Fund → Track → Adjust → Report → Learn**
