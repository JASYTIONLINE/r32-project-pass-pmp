## 📊 Cost Metrics

| Metric | Description | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Planned Value (PV)** | Budgeted cost for work scheduled | $5,000 | Based on baseline |
| **Actual Cost (AC)** | Cost incurred for work completed | $5,500 | Includes overages |
| **Earned Value (EV)** | Budgeted cost for completed work | $4,500 | Less completed than planned |
| **Cost Performance Index (CPI)** | EV ÷ AC | 0.82 | Over budget |
| **Cost Variance (CV)** | EV − AC | –$1,000 | Behind plan |
| **Estimate at Completion (EAC)** | Forecasted total cost | $11,500 | Trend-based projection |
| **Budget at Completion (BAC)** | Total approved budget | $10,000 | From Cost Baseline |

> 📌 CPI < 1.0 means the project is over budget.  
> CV < 0 indicates cost overrun.  
> EAC > BAC means final costs will exceed planned budget.
