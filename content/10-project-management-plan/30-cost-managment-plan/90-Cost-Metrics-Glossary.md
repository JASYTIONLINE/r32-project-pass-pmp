# 📘 Cost Metrics Glossary – Project PASS PMP  
**Folder:** `/30-cost-management-plan/`  
**Bloom’s Level:** 2 – Understanding (Define, Apply, Interpret)

---

## 📎 Purpose

This glossary provides short, exam-ready definitions of core **cost management and Earned Value Management (EVM)** terms.  
All definitions are aligned with PMI usage and directly referenced in:

- [Cost Management Plan](10-cost-management-plan.md)  
- [Cost Performance Report](20-cost-performance-report.md)  
- [Cost Baseline](50-Cost-Baseline.md)  
- [Schedule Performance Report](../20-schedule-management/05-schedule-performance-report.md)

---

## 📚 Terms and Definitions

### **1. Cost Performance Index (CPI)**  
**Formula:** EV ÷ AC  
A measure of cost efficiency.  
- **CPI < 1.0** = Over budget  
- **CPI > 1.0** = Under budget  
> Used in: [Cost Performance Report](20-cost-performance-report.md)

---

### **2. Cost Variance (CV)**  
**Formula:** EV − AC  
The dollar difference between earned value and actual cost.  
- **CV < 0** = Over budget  
- **CV > 0** = Under budget  
> Used in: [Cost Change Log](30-cost-change-log.md)

---

### **3. Earned Value (EV)**  
The value of work **actually completed**, based on the baseline.  
Used to calculate CPI, CV, and EAC.

---

### **4. Actual Cost (AC)**  
The **real cost** incurred for completed work.  
Tracked continuously and compared to EV and PV.

---

### **5. Planned Value (PV)**  
The budgeted cost of work **scheduled** to be completed by a point in time.  
Helps calculate SPI (Schedule Performance Index) and performance trends.

---

### **6. Estimate at Completion (EAC)**  
**Formula (typical):** BAC ÷ CPI  
Forecast of total project cost based on current spending trends.  
- **EAC > BAC** = Expecting overrun  
> Used in: [Cost Performance Trend Chart](Cost-Performance-Trend-Chart.md)

---

### **7. Budget at Completion (BAC)**  
The **total approved project budget**, based on the [Cost Baseline](50-Cost-Baseline.md).  
Used as the target for completion.

---

### **8. Management Reserve (MR)**  
Budget set aside for **unknown unknowns** (outside scope of baseline).  
Not included in BAC. Triggered only via formal change request.

---

### **9. Contingency Reserve**  
Funds allocated for **known risks**.  
Usually tracked separately but included in the cost baseline.
