# 📊 Cost Performance Trend Chart – Project PASS PMP  
**Folder:** `/30-cost-management-plan/`  
**Bloom’s Level:** 2 – Understanding (Interpret, Compare, Visualize)

---

## 📎 Purpose

This chart tracks **cost performance trends** across multiple reporting periods, using Earned Value Management (EVM) metrics:

- **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**  
- **Cost Variance (CV)**  
- **Estimate at Completion (EAC)**  
- **Budget at Completion (BAC)**

It provides an easy-to-read visual and numerical breakdown of **project cost health over time**.

## 📈 Trend Table

| Report Date | EV ($) | AC ($) | PV ($) | CPI | CV ($) | EAC ($) | BAC ($) | Notes |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|-----|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Oct 13, 2025 | 4,500  | 5,500  | 5,000  | 0.82 | –1,000 | 11,500  | 10,000  | Over budget (early) |
| Oct 27, 2025 | 6,800  | 7,600  | 7,200  | 0.89 | –800   | 10,900  | 10,000  | Trend improving |
| Nov 10, 2025 | 9,500  | 9,900  | 9,000  | 0.96 | –400   | 10,300  | 10,000  | Nearly recovered |

---

## 📊 Observations

- CPI is improving over time → team is regaining cost control  
- EAC is trending down → total projected spend is stabilizing  
- Variance is narrowing → most overages occurred early in development  

---

## 🔁 Interpretation Guidance

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|--------------------|
| **CPI < 1.0** | Project is over budget |
| **CPI > 1.0** | Project is under budget |
| **CV < 0** | Over budget in absolute dollars |
| **EAC > BAC** | Final spend expected to exceed plan |

## 📘 Tips for Learners

- Pair this chart with the [Cost Performance Report](20-cost-performance-report.md) to see how metrics are calculated  
- Compare to the [Schedule Performance Report](../20-schedule-management/05-schedule-performance-report.md) to assess time-cost alignment  
- Use the trend to justify decisions about buffer use, resource shifts, or scope adjustments
