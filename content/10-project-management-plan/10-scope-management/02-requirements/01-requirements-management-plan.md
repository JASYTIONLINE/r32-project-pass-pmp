# Requirements Management Plan

## 1. Purpose

This Requirements Management Plan defines how project requirements will be **identified, documented, analyzed, and managed** throughout the project lifecycle. It ensures that stakeholder expectations are clearly translated into deliverables and that requirements remain traceable from initiation to closure.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Capture and validate **business, stakeholder, and technical requirements**
- Maintain **traceability** from requirements to deliverables
- Define roles, responsibilities, and tools for managing requirements
- Enable effective **change management** for evolving requirements

---

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Project Manager | Oversees the requirements process and ensures alignment with scope |
| Business Analyst | Facilitates requirement gathering and documentation |
| Stakeholders | Provide, review, and approve requirements |
| Development/Technical Team | Validate feasibility and contribute to solution design |

---

## 4. Requirements Collection Process

1. Conduct stakeholder interviews, workshops, or surveys  
2. Analyze business objectives and constraints  
3. Document requirements in a clear, testable format  
4. Validate requirements with stakeholders for accuracy and completeness  
5. Baseline approved requirements  

---

## 5. Requirements Documentation

Requirements may be captured in various formats, including:
- Business Requirements Documents (BRDs)
- User Stories (for Agile environments)
- Functional and Non-functional Specifications
- Use Cases or Process Diagrams

Each requirement should be:
- **Unique** (no duplicates)
- **Testable**
- **Clear and concise**

---

## 6. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

The RTM is used to **map requirements to project deliverables**, ensuring each requirement is addressed through design, development, testing, and acceptance.

The RTM supports:
- Impact analysis for change requests
- Test case generation
- Verification of completed deliverables

> ðŸ“Ž See: [Requirements Traceability Matrix](./Requirements-Traceability-Matrix.md)

---

## 7. Change Management for Requirements

If a stakeholder proposes a change to an existing requirement:

1. A formal **change request** is submitted  
2. The change is logged and reviewed for impact on scope, cost, and schedule  
3. The project manager or change control board (CCB) evaluates and approves/rejects  
4. If approved, the requirement and related documents are updated  
5. Stakeholders are informed of the change and its implications

---

## 8. Requirement Prioritization

Requirements should be prioritized based on:
- Business value
- Technical risk
- Cost of implementation
- Stakeholder impact

Common techniques:
- MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
- Weighted scoring models
- Agile backlog ranking

---

## 9. Tools and Techniques

- Requirements management systems (e.g., Jama, Jira, Azure DevOps)
- Workshops, prototyping, and user interviews
- RTM templates
- Process flowcharts or wireframes

---

## 10. Quality Assurance

To ensure high-quality requirements:
- Conduct peer reviews and validation sessions
- Use standard templates for consistency
- Apply acceptance criteria to each requirement
- Confirm alignment with scope, objectives, and business value

---

## 11. Assumptions and Constraints

**Assumptions:**
- Stakeholders will be available for review and clarification
- Requirements are stable and will only change through formal processes

**Constraints:**
- Time or budget limitations
- Regulatory or compliance constraints
- Limited stakeholder availability
