# Policy: Glossary-First Integration in *The Last Gate* Fiction  

## Purpose  
To ensure that every use of PMI terminology within *The Last Gate* narrative is scientifically accurate, contextually faithful, and aligned with PMI standards. This policy guarantees that the fiction functions both as lore and as a living glossary, supporting exam recall and conceptual clarity.  

## Core Rule  
**Glossary definitions are the authoritative source.** No term may appear in narrative unless its usage demonstrates the meaning found in the glossary.  

## Application Protocol  

1. **Check Before Use**  
   - Before writing a scene, paragraph, or sentence containing a PMI term, consult the glossary.  
   - Confirm the canonical PMI definition and note any exam cue.  

2. **Build Context Around Definition**  
   - A paragraph or scene must *teach the term through story*.  
   - Characters, conflict, or environment should illustrate the concept so that a reader unfamiliar with PMI could infer the definition.  

3. **Anchor Terms vs. Supporting Terms**  
   - **Anchor Terms** (e.g., project environment, stakeholder engagement, governance, scope, risk, value delivery) must drive the structure of full scenes.  
   - **Supporting Terms** (e.g., logbook, baseline, information radiator) may be layered in as details but must still respect glossary fidelity.  

4. **Fidelity Check**  
   - After drafting, compare the paragraph to the glossary entry.  
   - If the scene does not convey the definition accurately, revise until alignment is achieved.  

5. **Metaphor Boundaries**  
   - Metaphors are allowed only if they reinforce the glossary definition.  
   - Example: temperature instability may symbolize external enterprise environmental factors, but must be explicitly tied to “project environment” as PMI defines it.  

6. **Narrative Consistency**  
   - Each term should appear consistently across the story world.  
   - Once a metaphor or scene embodiment is established for a term, reuse and evolve it rather than contradict it.  

## Enforcement  
- Drafts must undergo a glossary-fidelity review before acceptance int
