# 🎬 Welcome to the Writer’s Room  

This is the heart of the JASYTI Knowledge Base—where structure meets story, and policies meet caffeine.  
Every document here keeps the writing ecosystem consistent across **Guidance**, **Structured Learning**, and **Lore Door**.  
Think of it as both a manual and a playground: rules up front, tools in the back.

---

## 🧭 How This Folder Works  

The Writer’s Room houses everything that governs *how content is created, reviewed, and formatted*.  
Documents here fall into five categories:  

1. **Policies** – what you *must* follow  
2. **Procedures / Prompts** – what you *use to do the work*  
3. **Scripts** – what the *machines* follow  
4. **Standards** – what *“done right”* looks like  
5. **Templates** – your *fill-in-the-blank starting points*

## 📜 Policies  
Policies define the **rules of authorship** across all layers—governance, style, and canon.  
They set the tone and accuracy that bind Structured Learning, Lore Door, and Guidance under one Author voice.

---

## ⚙️ Procedures & Prompts  
Procedures and prompts are **interactive guides**—step-by-step tools for humans or GPTs to execute consistent workflows.  
If policies are laws, these are the playbooks.

**Files**
- [[repositories/r30-project-pass-pmp/contents/00-project-pass-pmp/40-quallity-managment-plan/80-writers-room/prmt-1-no-yaml-windows11-gpt-project-execution|Windows 11 GPT Project Execution Prompt]] — Walks GPT through task-by-task project execution logic.  

---

## 🧩 Scripts  
Scripts are **automation helpers**. They validate, lint, or enforce the technical rules that policies define.  
They’re the quiet enforcers that keep your YAML from rebelling.

**Files**
- [[repositories/r30-project-pass-pmp/contents/00-project-pass-pmp/40-quallity-managment-plan/80-writers-room/scr-1-deihc-yaml-linter.py|YAML Linter Script]] — Scans every file for missing or malformed frontmatter and compliance fields.  

---

## 🧱 Standards  
Standards define **what “good” looks like**.  
They codify the technical and creative frameworks that keep every page readable, valid, and uniform.

**Files**
- [[repositories/r30-project-pass-pmp/contents/00-project-pass-pmp/40-quallity-managment-plan/80-writers-room/std-1-tlg-narrative-rulebook|TLG Narrative Rulebook]] — Governs episodic flow, scene mechanics, and lore-world coherence.  

---

## 🪄 Templates  
Templates are **starting frameworks**—the reusable shells that speed up creation and ensure structure compliance.  
Writers, editors, and GPTs use these as scaffolds for new material.

**Files**
- [[repositories/r30-project-pass-pmp/contents/00-project-pass-pmp/40-quallity-managment-plan/80-writers-room/tem-1-markdown-template-for-quartz-environments|Markdown Template for Quartz Environments]] — The master frontmatter and body format used across the KB.

---

## 🧠 Summary  

Every file here plays a role in making sure the Knowledge Base writes with **one brain, many voices**.  
Policies tell us *why*, Standards show us *how*, and Tools make it *faster*.  
Follow them all, and every document you publish will sound like it came from the same sharp, sarcastic genius we call **the Author**.
