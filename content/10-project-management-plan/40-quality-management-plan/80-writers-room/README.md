# Welcome to the Writer’s Room  

If the Knowledge Base had a heartbeat, this would be it.  
Half coffee shop, half control center — this is where policies are written, robots are trained, and writers are politely bullied into consistency.  

Every document here answers one sacred question:  
**“How do we write so it feels like one brilliant person with ten personalities wrote it?”**

## 🧭 What This Folder Is  

The Writer’s Room is the **governance and production studio** for everything written under JASYTI’s banner.  
It’s where structure meets style — the place that decides how humans, GPTs, and fictional AIs all sound like they’re on the same page (and occasionally the same espresso).  

It covers:  
- Authoring rules and YAML standards  
- Tone, humor, and learning-level control  
- Lore writing and story governance  
- Tools, templates, and prompts for both people and machines  

Whether you’re building a policy, a study guide, or a space opera about stakeholder engagement, this folder is the law, the guide, and the caffeine supply.

## 🪩 What You’ll Find  

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Policy** | The *why* behind the rules. These define tone, structure, and accuracy for every layer of content. |
| **Procedure / Prompt** | The *how-to’s* — playbooks for GPTs and humans. Step-by-step execution guides. |
| **Script** | The *automation muscle*. Code that enforces what policy politely suggests. |
| **Standard** | The *blueprint* — defines what “good” looks like, from structure to story rhythm. |
| **Template** | The *starter pack*. Plug, play, and pretend you always knew what YAML meant. |

Each section has its own set of tools. Together they create a system that’s equal parts **discipline and chaos**, just like the writers who use it.

## 📜 Policies  

Policies define the **creative constitution** of this Knowledge Base.  
They keep every voice in sync and make sure PMI canon and comedy never cross wires.

## ⚙️ Procedures & Prompts  

Procedures are the **how-to manuals for creation**, whether you’re a person or a GPT with ambition.  
These files don’t just explain — they *execute*.  

**Documents**
- [[repositories/r30-project-pass-pmp/contents/00-project-pass-pmp/40-quallity-managment-plan/80-writers-room/prmt-1-no-yaml-windows11-gpt-project-execution|Windows 11 GPT Project Execution Prompt]]  

---

## 🤖 Scripts  

Scripts are the **behind-the-scenes enforcers** — little watchdogs that make sure the vault stays tidy and every YAML field remembers its manners.  

**Documents**
- [[repositories/r30-project-pass-pmp/contents/00-project-pass-pmp/40-quallity-managment-plan/80-writers-room/scr-1-deihc-yaml-linter.py|YAML Linter Script]]  

---

## 🧱 Standards  

Standards define what *“done right”* looks like.  
They don’t tell you how to think — they tell you when you’ve stopped breaking things.  

**Documents**
- [[repositories/r30-project-pass-pmp/contents/00-project-pass-pmp/40-quallity-managment-plan/80-writers-room/std-1-tlg-narrative-rulebook|TLG Narrative Rulebook]]  

---

## 🪄 Templates  

Templates are the **assembly lines of genius**.  
You don’t start from scratch here; you start from structure — clean, compliant, and ready for flair.  

**Documents**
- [[repositories/r30-project-pass-pmp/contents/00-project-pass-pmp/40-quallity-managment-plan/80-writers-room/tem-1-markdown-template-for-quartz-environments|Markdown Template for Quartz Environments]]  
- [[repositories/r30-project-pass-pmp/contents/00-project-pass-pmp/40-quallity-managment-plan/80-writers-room/tem-2-tlg-backstory-template|TLG Backstory Template]]

## 🧩 How to Use This Room  

1. **Start with the Policies.**  
   They tell you why the world spins the way it does.  

2. **Grab a Template.**  
   If you’re typing YAML by hand, you’ve already made a mistake.  

3. **Follow the Standards.**  
   They make your content sound like it actually belongs here.  

4. **Run the Scripts.**  
   Let the bots judge your work before the humans do.  

5. **Use the Prompts.**  
   Because sometimes the best coauthor is silicon and sleep-deprived.

## 🧠 Philosophy: The Author’s Voice  

Everything in this system — policy, story, or satire — speaks in **The Author’s voice**:  
a dryly amused project manager who’s seen the apocalypse postponed by a change request.  

That voice is the soul of this Knowledge Base: smart, human, a little cynical, but never cruel.  
If it reads like that, you’re doing it right.  

---

## ☕ Final Words  

This isn’t a documentation folder.  
It’s a **creative command center** disguised as one.  

Follow the rules. Break them stylishly.  
And remember: **boring is the only real compliance violation.**
