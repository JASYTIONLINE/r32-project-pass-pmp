# Business Case — Project PASS PMP

## 1. Executive Summary
**Project PASS PMP** is both a professional study platform and a **live project execution lab** for the team preparing for the PMP® exam.  
It consolidates all exam-aligned content into a *Single Source of Truth (SoT)* website **and** operates as a working case study where the team applies every PMI process group and ECO task in real time.  

This project delivers two outcomes:
1. A collaboratively developed, end-to-end **Project Management Plan**, built through live execution rather than simulation.
2. A fully functional PMP knowledge base published via **Obsidian → Quartz → GitHub Pages**.  
---

## 2. Problem Statement
- The Simplilearn course has ended; the team now needs a **practical capstone** to reinforce ECO-based project management through hands-on practice.  
- Traditional mock plans don’t give real exposure to integrated tools, communication flow, or change control.  
- Members live in different time zones and need a **light-touch collaboration model** that allows full participation with minimal synchronous meetings.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution
Launch **Project PASS PMP** as a global, asynchronous project lab that:
- Follows the **PMI ECO doctrine**, particularly 3.2 “Evaluate and deliver project benefits and value.”  
- Executes every process step from **initiation to closure**, producing all subsidiary plans and logs.  
- Uses a **unified communications ecosystem** governed by a **PACE plan** (Primary–Alternate–Contingency–Emergency) so that every team member knows *where* and *how* to communicate.  
- Stores all artifacts in a shared **GitHub repository**, providing:  
  - Always-on global access to project data.  
  - Seamless upload of deliverables without gatekeeping.  
  - Full **version control** and change-tracking for audit integrity.  
- Publishes the finished site as an open, navigable PMP study reference.

---

## 4. Strategic Alignment
- **Educational:** Reinforces Domains 1–3 through direct ECO application.  
- **Organizational:** Demonstrates disciplined virtual collaboration and configuration management.  
- **Technological:** Uses open-source platforms to model professional remote-team operations.  
- **Value Delivery:** Fulfills the ECO mandate to *evaluate and deliver project benefits and value* by producing a real, public deliverable.

---

## 5. Implementation Model
- **Cadence:** Team-defined, proposed **Saturday-to-Saturday** sprint cycle.  
- **Meetings:** 1–2 hours weekly for sprint review/retrospective; all other work completed asynchronously.  
- **Governance:** Strict adherence to PMI process-group logic; no deviations without change-request approval.  
- **Technology Plan:**  
  - **Primary (PACE – Primary):** GitHub repository and Issues board for deliverable tracking.  
  - **Alternate:** Shared messaging platform (e.g., Pumble or Slack) for quick coordination.  
  - **Contingency:** Email thread for notifications or when chat platforms are unavailable.  
  - **Emergency:** Direct phone or text contact list for time-critical issues.  
  - This framework ensures communication remains continuous even if a tool fails.

## 6. Expected Benefits
| Category | Benefit | Measure of Success |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Applied Learning** | End-to-end execution of all PMBOK 6/7 and ECO processes | Each member authors ≥1 plan component |
| **Unified Communication** | Clear, predictable collaboration channels (PACE) | 100 % adherence to the communication plan |
| **Global Access** | GitHub central repository with version control | Zero lost or conflicting file versions |
| **Knowledge Retention** | Reinforced through practice, not lecture | Improved mock-exam performance |
| **Portfolio Value** | Public knowledge base demonstrating PMI discipline | Live site published and maintained |
| **Efficiency** | Minimal meetings, asynchronous workflow | ≤ 2 hours group time per week |

---

## 7. Cost–Benefit Overview
| Resource | Type | Cost Basis | Notes |
|-----------|------|------------|-------|
| Obsidian + Quartz + GitHub | Platform | \$0 | Open-source stack |
| Team member effort | Labor | ~2 hrs meeting + individual sprint work | Low overhead |
| Sponsor / PM | Time | 5–10 hrs weekly | Oversight + QA |
| ROI | Benefit | Certification readiness + permanent asset | Tangible deliverable + knowledge gain |

---

## 8. Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Schedule drift | Moderate | Lock sprint goals; track via GitHub Issues |
| Uneven participation | High | Assign artifact ownership; rotate roles |
| Tool failure or access gap | Low | Follow PACE plan hierarchy |
| Scope expansion | Moderate | Change-request control |
| Burnout / overload | Low | Short meetings; async flexibility |

---

## 9. Success Metrics
- Fully published, navigable **PMP knowledge base** on GitHub Pages.  
- Completed, validated **Project Management Plan** with all subsidiary documents.  
- Functioning **PACE communication plan** adopted by all members.  
- Demonstrated proficiency in PMI process groups and ECO tasks.  
- Documented **Lessons Learned** log at closure.

---

## 10. Recommendation
Approve **Project PASS PMP** as both a **knowledge-base build** and a **live ECO-aligned project-management lab**.  
The unified communications and technology plan ensures seamless global collaboration, while the live execution format transforms study into applied experience—reinforcing every skill required for PMP certification and producing a professional artifact of enduring value.
