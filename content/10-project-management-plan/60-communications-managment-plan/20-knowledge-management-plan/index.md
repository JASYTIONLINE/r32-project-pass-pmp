## Why This Folder Matters

This is the core of how we **learn from ourselves**.

Everything in this folder is about turning working insights ‚Äî decisions, fixes, patterns, feedback ‚Äî into reusable, structured knowledge. If you want to understand how we make what we know accessible, usable, and reliable across the project, this is where to start.

## What's Inside

### üìÑ [Knowledge Management Plan](pla-knowledge-management.md)  
Outlines our strategy for capturing, structuring, sharing, and archiving knowledge across the team. Connects to every other file in this folder. Start here.

### üìÑ [Knowledge Capture Workflow](pro-knowledge-capture-workflow.md)  
Step-by-step procedure for turning real work (notes, issues, discussions) into formal contributions to the knowledge base. It defines when, how, and by whom knowledge is recorded and published.

---

### üìÑ [Knowledge Types Standard](std-knowledge-types.md)  
Defines how we categorize knowledge: procedural, reference, contextual, reusable, etc. This file governs naming conventions, structure, and classification rules.

---

### üìÑ [Knowledge Contribution Log](log-knowledge-contributions.md)  
Chronological ledger of who contributed what, when, and how it was classified. Used to track participation, support retrospectives, and measure reuse over time.
