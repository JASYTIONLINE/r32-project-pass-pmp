# **Collaboration Index
– Project PASS PMP**

**Bottom Line Up Front:**  
This folder contains all documentation for our **communications and collaboration systems** under the PACE framework (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency).  
It explains *how we meet, communicate, share files, track work, and publish deliverables*.

---

## **System Overview**

- **Messaging Platform (Pumble):** Central hub for day-to-day coordination. Keeps all communication searchable, persistent, and professionally archived.  
- **Formal & Informal Meeting Platform (Jitsi):** Used for all live sessions and scrums. Browser-based, secure, and requires no downloads or sign-ins.  
- **Task & Workflow Platform (Trello):** Visual board for tracking assignments, blockers, and progress through each study cycle.  
- **File Collaboration Platform (Google Drive):** Shared workspace for drafting, editing, and storing active files before final publication.  
- **Archival & Publication Platform (GitHub):** Long-term repository and public access site for finalized materials.  
- **Alternate & Contingency Tools (Slack, Google Meet, WhatsApp, Email/SMS):** Backup systems for continuity if any primary platform becomes unavailable.  

Team members should review this page first, then follow the wiki links to specific platform guides for detailed setup and procedures.
