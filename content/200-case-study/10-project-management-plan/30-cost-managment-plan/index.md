# Cost Management – Document Index

## 🧭 Why This Folder Matters

Welcome to the **financial control center** of Project PASS PMP.

This folder doesn't just "track the budget" — it shows **how professional project managers estimate, lock, report, and govern every dollar** of a project. It’s designed to teach PMP candidates, new contributors, and project teams how PMI-based cost management works — not just in theory, but in *clickable, usable files*.

> 📌 Use this folder to understand the entire flow of project cost control:
**Estimate → Baseline → Fund → Track → Adjust → Report → Learn**

## 📂 Core Documents & Teaching Summaries

### 📄 [[10-cost-management-plan|Cost Management Plan]]  
Start here. This document explains the entire system — how cost estimates are created, how the budget is approved and locked, how changes are controlled, and how performance is tracked. It’s your policy, playbook, and user guide in one:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

---

### 📄 [[40-Cost-Estimates|Cost Estimates]]  
Explore the breakdown of hours, effort, and costs by task or workstream. Learn how **bottom-up estimating** connects deliverables to dollars. All calculations feed the baseline:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

### 📄 [[50-Cost-Baseline|Cost Baseline]]  
This is the **locked, approved budget**. It’s time-phased and tracked. Every cost performance report and change log references this file as the foundation for cost control:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

---

### 📄 [[60-Funding-Requirements|Funding Requirements]]  
Not all funds are released at once. This file shows **when money is needed** across milestones and phases. It teaches financial pacing and resource timing in Agile and predictive projects:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

---

## 📊 Reporting & Control Artifacts

### 📄 [[20-cost-performance-report|Cost Performance Report]]  
Learn how **Earned Value Management (EVM)** works in real life. See how CPI, CV, and EAC are calculated and interpreted. This report helps teams and learners assess budget health over time:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

---

### 📄 [[30-cost-change-log|Cost Change Log]]  
This is your cost governance ledger. Every approved change — its reason, dollar impact, and CR ID — is logged here. Great for audits and reinforcing discipline in cost control:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

---

## 📚 Supporting Educational Tools

### 📄 [[70-Budget-Audit-Checklist|Budget Audit Checklist]]  
Before you close a project or pass a phase gate, this checklist ensures you've validated everything: estimates, approvals, reports, change records, and baseline compliance.

---

### 📄 [[80-Cost-Performance-Trend-Chart|Cost Performance Trend Chart]]  
This file shows **how your budget is behaving over time**. Track changes to CPI, EAC, and CV across reporting cycles. Visual trend spotting made simple.

---

### 📄 [[90-Cost-Metrics-Glossary|Cost Metrics Glossary]]  
Short, exam-ready definitions of CPI, CV, EAC, BAC, and more — in plain English. Links to where each metric appears in reports, plans, or performance dashboards.
