# Risk Types Standard
– Project PASS PMP

## Purpose

This document defines consistent risk categories used to classify threats and opportunities across Project PASS PMP. Standardized types improve clarity, tracking, and analysis.

## Categories

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Technical | Relates to tools, platforms, automation | GitHub outage, Quartz failure |
| Content | Related to lesson clarity, structure, quality | Incomplete glossary, scope creep |
| Resource | Gaps in contributor availability | Writer unresponsive, reviewer unavailable |
| Schedule | Delays or compression threats | Missed milestone, publishing backup |
| Cost | Risk of budget overrun | Extra hours logged |
| External | Risks from outside team or system | PMI exam changes, hosting policy shift |
| Process | Risk in workflows or documentation | Missed RACI update, link rot |

- Multiple tags allowed, but one must be declared “primary”
