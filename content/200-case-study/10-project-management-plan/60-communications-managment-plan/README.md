# Communications Management ‚Äì Overview  
**Folder:** `/60-communications-management-plan/`

---

## üß≠ Purpose  

This folder defines how information moves through the project ‚Äî from casual coordination to official stakeholder reporting ‚Äî and how continuity is maintained when systems fail.  
It ensures that every participant in **Project PASS PMP** knows *what to say*, *who to tell*, *where to say it*, and *what to do when they can‚Äôt.*

Communication is not a soft skill here; it‚Äôs a **governed system** designed to maintain flow, traceability, and accountability.

> **PMI Alignment:**  
> This section covers all three PMBOK 6 processes:  
> 1. **Plan Communications Management**  
> 2. **Manage Communications**  
> 3. **Monitor Communications**  
> It also aligns with ECO 2021 *Domain 1 (People)* and *Domain 3 (Business Environment)* ‚Äî building stakeholder trust and project transparency.

---

## üß© How This Folder Fits the Project  

The **Communications Management Plan** connects directly to:
- The **Resource Management Plan (50)** ‚Äî defines who communicates  
- The **Stakeholder Register (Initiating phase)** ‚Äî defines who receives  
- The **Quality and Risk Plans (40 / 70)** ‚Äî define how feedback is managed  

Together, these ensure communication is treated like any other deliverable: **planned, measured, improved, and archived.**

## üìò The PACE Framework  

Project PASS PMP uses the **PACE** model to guarantee communication continuity under any condition:  

| Level | Meaning | Purpose | Example Tools |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **P ‚Äì Primary** | Normal daily communication | Standard operations | Pumble, GitHub Issues |
| **A ‚Äì Alternate** | Temporary substitute | Backup for minor outages | Jitsi, Trello comments |
| **C ‚Äì Contingency** | Extended outage workaround | Medium-term continuity | Google Meet, Telegram |
| **E ‚Äì Emergency** | Total failure or safety check | Final fallback for accountability | SMS, Signal, Email |

PACE ensures we always know the *next move* when a channel fails ‚Äî a direct quality safeguard for communications.

---

## üß† Folder Contents  

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **[10-pla-communications-management.md](10-pla-communications-management.md)** | The master plan ‚Äî defines what gets communicated, by whom, and how often. Covers cadence, escalation, and monitoring. |
| **[20-pol-communications-pace.md.md](20-pol-communications-pace.md.md)** | The PACE policy ‚Äî defines channel hierarchy, continuity protocols, and backup procedures. |
| **[30-pro-communications-collaboration-index.md](30-pro-communications-collaboration-index.md)** | The operational playbook ‚Äî documents which tools we use (Pumble, Jitsi, Trello, Drive, GitHub) and how they interact. |
| **[40-log-communications.md](40-log-communications.md)** | The accountability ledger ‚Äî logs major messages, meetings, decisions, and communication failures for traceability. |
| **[index.md](index.md)** | Quick navigation and reading order for the folder. |

## üîÅ Communication Flow  

**Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Improve**  

| Phase | Artifact | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Plan** | `10-pla-communications-management.md` | Defines strategy, stakeholder needs, cadence, and channels. |
| **Execute (QA)** | `20-pol-communications-pace.md.md`, `30-pro-communications-collaboration-index.md` | Implements and enforces the policy; ensures redundancy and access. |
| **Monitor (QC)** | `40-log-communications.md` | Records all major events and incidents; feeds retrospectives. |
| **Improve** | Integrated through the **Quality** and **Risk Plans** | Analyzes communication failures to refine future protocols. |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Governance and QA/QC  

| Type | Mechanism | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Quality Assurance (QA)** | PACE Policy + Collaboration Procedure | Prevents communication failures by defining hierarchy and tool usage. |
| **Quality Control (QC)** | Communications Log | Detects and documents breakdowns or lapses for correction. |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Feedback loops in retrospectives | Lessons from the log and retrospectives update the PACE policy quarterly. |

This governance structure keeps the system adaptive while ensuring compliance with PMI‚Äôs *Monitor Communications* process.

---

## üîó Integration with Other Plans  

| Related Plan | Relationship |
|---------------|--------------|
| **Resource Management (50)** | Defines *who* communicates and their availability. |
| **Stakeholder Engagement (Initiating)** | Defines *to whom* communication is directed. |
| **Quality Management (40)** | Treats communications as part of quality governance. |
| **Risk Management (70)** | Communication breakdowns become risk triggers. |
| **Procurement Management (80)** | Aligns external vendor communications with the same PACE structure. |

---

## üó£ Roles & Responsibilities  

| Role | Communication Focus |
|------|----------------------|
| **Sponsor** | Approves summary reports and receives escalation alerts. |
| **Project Manager** | Owns the plan, cadence, and reporting responsibilities. |
| **Technical Lead** | Maintains publishing transparency (GitHub logs, deployment). |
| **Contributors / Reviewers** | Report blockers and task progress using designated tools. |
| **Learning Analyst** | Monitors learner feedback and integrates insights into future messaging. |

## üîç Success Criteria  

The Communications system is working when:  
- No communication breakdowns occur without an alternate channel activated.  
- Stakeholders receive the right updates on time.  
- The log reflects consistency and accuracy in reporting.  
- Team members use the prescribed tools ‚Äî not ad hoc personal channels.  
- PACE continuity rules are validated during each retrospective.
