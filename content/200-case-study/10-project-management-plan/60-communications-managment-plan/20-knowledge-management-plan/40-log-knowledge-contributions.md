# Knowledge Contribution Log
– Project PASS PMP  

---

## Purpose

This log serves as a historical record of all captured knowledge within the project. It tracks who contributed what, when it was added, and how it fits into the Knowledge Management Plan.  
Maintaining this log ensures accountability, transparency, and a clear audit trail of how the knowledge base evolved.

---

## How to Use This Log

- Record every new knowledge contribution as soon as it’s added or updated.  
- Classify each item according to the [Knowledge Types Standard](std-knowledge-types.md).  
- Include related references (e.g., issue number, meeting notes, or linked artifacts).  
- Reviewed and updated weekly by the PM or Knowledge Coordinator.
