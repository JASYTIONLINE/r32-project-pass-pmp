# Knowledge Management ‚Äì Overview  
**Folder:** `/20-knowledge-management-plan/`

---

## üéØ Purpose  

This folder defines how **Project PASS PMP** turns information into insight and insight into improvement.  
It establishes the framework for **capturing, classifying, sharing, and reusing** lessons learned across every phase of the project lifecycle.  

The goal is to prevent knowledge loss, encourage collaboration, and ensure that every experience ‚Äî success or failure ‚Äî strengthens the organization‚Äôs collective intelligence.

> **PMI Alignment:**  
> Fulfills the *Manage Project Knowledge* process from PMBOK 6 and supports ECO 2021 **Domain 3 (Business Environment)** by embedding continual learning and value realization within the project system.

---

## üß© How This Folder Fits the Project  

The **Knowledge Management Plan** connects the operational side of learning (how we collect and store information) to the governance side (how we improve processes based on what we learn).  
It bridges **Communications (60)** and **Quality (40)** ‚Äî the former provides inputs (discussions, logs, feedback), the latter consumes outputs (lessons, improvements).

| Source | Flow | Destination |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Communications Logs | ‚Üí | Knowledge Capture Workflow |
| Knowledge Repository | ‚Üí | Quality Continuous Improvement |
| Lessons Learned | ‚Üí | Updated Templates and Standards |

---

## üß± Folder Structure  

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **[10-pla-knowledge-management.md](10-pla-knowledge-management.md)** | The master plan ‚Äî defines knowledge lifecycle, governance roles, and repositories. |
| **[20-pro-knowledge-capture-workflow.md](20-pro-knowledge-capture-workflow.md)** | Procedural steps for capturing and validating new knowledge assets. |
| **[30-std-knowledge-types.md](30-std-knowledge-types.md)** | Classification standard defining reference, procedural, contextual, reusable, and retrospective knowledge types. |
| **[40-log-knowledge-contributions.md](40-log-knowledge-contributions.md)** | The official ledger ‚Äî records who contributed what, when, and how knowledge was reused. |
| **[index.md](index.md)** | Navigation and reading order for this folder. |

## üîÅ Knowledge Flow  

**Capture ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Store ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Improve**  

| Phase | Artifact | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Capture** | `20-pro-knowledge-capture-workflow.md` | Collects data from communications, retrospectives, and reports. |
| **Validate (QA)** | `30-std-knowledge-types.md` | Ensures classification accuracy and governance compliance. |
| **Store** | `10-pla-knowledge-management.md` | Defines where and how knowledge is archived. |
| **Share (QC)** | `40-log-knowledge-contributions.md` | Verifies participation and tracks reuse. |
| **Improve** | Integrated through the Quality Plan | Lessons feed process refinement and training. |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Governance and QA/QC  

| Function | Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Quality Assurance (QA)** | Knowledge Standards + Capture Workflow | Prevent inconsistency by enforcing structure, naming, and validation before publication. |
| **Quality Control (QC)** | Contribution Log + Retrospectives | Detect missing, outdated, or duplicate entries and track active reuse metrics. |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Integration with Quality Plan | Knowledge metrics drive corrective and preventive actions in future phases. |

This creates a self-sustaining **QA/QC loop**:  
**QA** builds the framework ‚Üí **QC** measures its use ‚Üí results flow into **Continuous Improvement**.

---

## üîó Integration with Other Plans  

| Related Plan | Relationship |
|---------------|--------------|
| **Communications Management (60)** | Provides raw data through meeting notes and logs. |
| **Resource Management (50)** | Defines ownership and expertise distribution. |
| **Quality Management (40)** | Consumes knowledge outputs to refine procedures. |
| **Risk Management (70)** | Knowledge from past incidents informs mitigation strategies. |

---

## üß† Roles & Responsibilities  

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Project Manager** | Oversees KM implementation and ensures alignment with organizational strategy. |
| **Knowledge Manager / Writers Room Lead** | Maintains repositories, validates submissions, curates content. |
| **Technical QA** | Runs metadata checks, verifies YAML compliance. |
| **Contributors / SMEs** | Submit and update procedural or contextual knowledge. |
| **Learning Analyst** | Measures engagement, tracks reuse metrics, reports impact. |

---

## üìä Success Criteria  

The Knowledge Management System is successful when:  
- Every completed project produces at least one reusable artifact.  
- No duplicate or orphaned files exist in repositories.  
- Contributors maintain active submission cadence.  
- Lessons learned appear as implemented improvements in the Quality Plan.  
- Knowledge assets are tagged, indexed, and discoverable via Quartz search.  

---

## üß≠ Reading Order  

1. [Knowledge Management Plan (10)](10-pla-knowledge-management.md)  
2. [Knowledge Capture Workflow (20)](20-pro-knowledge-capture-workflow.md)  
3. [Knowledge Types Standard (30)](30-std-knowledge-types.md)  
4. [Knowledge Contribution Log (40)](40-log-knowledge-contributions.md)  
5. [Index](index.md)  

---

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways  

- **QA:** Standards and workflow ensure accurate, validated entries.  
- **QC:** Logs and retrospectives confirm the system is actually used.  
- **Continuity:** Communications feed Knowledge; Knowledge feeds Quality.  
- **PMI Alignment:** Directly supports *Manage Project Knowledge* and continuous improvement.  
- **Organizational Learning:** Turns experience into a strategic asset.
