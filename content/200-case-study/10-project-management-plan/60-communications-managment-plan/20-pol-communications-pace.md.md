# Global Team Communications Policy  

---

## 1. Purpose  

This policy establishes the official communications framework for all global project teams operating under the organization.  
Its purpose is to ensure stable, consistent, and accessible communication across time zones, platforms, and varying internet conditions.  
The policy adopts the **PACE structure** — *Primary, Alternate, Contingency, and Emergency* — to guarantee continuity under any circumstance.  

---

## 2. Scope  

This policy applies to all team members, contributors, and collaborators participating in project-related communications or documentation activities.  
It defines approved tools, expected use, and escalation procedures during communication failures.  

---

## 3. Guiding Principles  

The communications framework aligns with two interpretations of PACE:

1. **Operational PACE:** Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency — ensuring continuity of contact.  
2. **Organizational PACE:** Performance, Accountability, Collaboration, Engagement — defining how we work together.  

The system prioritizes **stability**, **simplicity**, and **accessibility** over novelty or cost.

## 4. Authorized Communication Platforms  

### 4.1 Chat – Pumble  
**Purpose:** Serve as the persistent, organized communication hub for all project discussions.  
**Advantages:**  
- Maintains full message history free of charge.  
- Channels organized by topic or project.  
- Secure operation without personal identifiers.  
- Reliable on low bandwidth connections.  

**Prohibited Substitutes:** WhatsApp or other personal messaging apps.  
*Rationale:* Personal chat apps lack search, structure, and archival control, leading to loss of professional records.  

---

### 4.2 Meetings – Jitsi Meet  
**Purpose:** Conduct live discussions, screen shares, and virtual meetings.  
**Advantages:**  
- Browser-based; no downloads or logins required.  
- No time limits or participant caps.  
- Consistent performance across low-bandwidth regions.  

**Alternate Option:** Google Meet (used only if Jitsi is unavailable).  
*Rationale:* Google Meet limits free sessions to one hour and requires sign-ins, which may restrict access for some members.  

---

### 4.3 Files – Google Drive  
**Purpose:** Central workspace for all live documents, collaboration drafts, and shared assets.  
**Advantages:**  
- Real-time co-authoring and commenting.  
- Simple permission management.  
- Ubiquitous access via browser or mobile device.  

---

### 4.4 Scheduling – Google Calendar  
**Purpose:** Coordinate meetings and synchronize project activities.  
**Advantages:**  
- Integrates with Jitsi, Trello, and Google Drive.  
- Automatically adjusts to each participant’s local time zone.  
- Serves as the single source of truth for meeting links and reminders.  

---

### 4.5 Tasks – Trello  
**Purpose:** Visual task and workflow management for all deliverables.  
**Advantages:**  
- Simple Kanban-style boards (To-Do, Doing, Done).  
- Clear visibility of progress and responsibility.  
- Lightweight interface suitable for all skill levels.  

**Prohibited Substitutes:** WhatsApp or SMS-based tracking.  
*Rationale:* These tools do not provide traceability or shared visibility of ongoing work.  

---

### 4.6 Archives – GitHub + Obsidian  
**Purpose:** Final publication and long-term record of all completed deliverables.  
**Advantages:**  
- Version-controlled repository using GitHub.  
- Integration with Obsidian for content management.  
- Public release through GitHub Pages for transparency and educational access.  

**Workflow Separation:**  
- *Google Drive* = Workspace for live edits and drafting.  
- *GitHub + Obsidian* = Repository for finalized, approved publications.  

---

## 5. Escalation Protocol (PACE Continuity)

| Level | Trigger | Platform | Action |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Primary** | Normal operations | Pumble / Jitsi / Drive / Trello | Conduct daily communication and coordination using all standard tools. |
| **Alternate** | Temporary platform failure | Google Meet / Microsoft Teams (Free) | Announce switch in #general channel and resume operations. |
| **Contingency** | Extended outage or login restriction | Telegram + FreeConferenceCall.com | Use Telegram for coordination; share FCC meeting link for voice. |
| **Emergency** | Total connectivity disruption | Signal / SMS / Email | Confirm safety and accountability with leadership; return to primary tools when possible. |

---

## 6. Implementation  

1. Establish shared Google Drive root folder for all working files.  
2. Create and configure Pumble workspace with required channels (`#general`, `#status`, `#meetings`, `#social`).  
3. Generate persistent Jitsi meeting link; embed it in recurring Google Calendar events.  
4. Launch Trello board for each project with lists labeled To-Do / Doing / Blocked / Done.  
5. Synchronize finalized work from Google Drive to GitHub via Obsidian for publication.  
6. Maintain a shared contact sheet (Google Sheet) with time zones and alternate communication details.  
7. Store a copy of this policy in Drive and on GitHub under `/governance/communications-policy.md`.  

---

## 7. Review and Maintenance  

This policy shall be reviewed annually or after any major platform change.  
Updates require consensus from the leadership council and must be reflected both in Drive and GitHub.
