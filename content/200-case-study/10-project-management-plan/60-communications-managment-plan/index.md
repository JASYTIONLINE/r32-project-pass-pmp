# Communications Management
– Document Index  

---

## Why This Folder Exists

This folder governs how communication happens across the project — not just tools, but purpose, timing, ownership, and backup plans. If you're looking for answers like:

- What should I send, and to whom?  
- What platform do we use for X?  
- Who owns communication with the sponsor?  
- How do we handle breakdowns or blackouts?

You'll find them all here.

This is the operational and strategic communications system for Project PASS PMP.

## What You'll Find Here

### 📄 [Communications Management Plan](pla-communications-management.md)  
Defines what gets communicated, when, by whom, and how often. Covers stakeholder needs, frequency, delivery channels, and responsibilities. This is the central plan that ties everything else together.

---

### 📄 [PACE Communications Policy](pol-communications-pace.md.md)  
Outlines our PACE structure — Primary, Alternate, Contingency, and Emergency communication channels. Establishes tool hierarchy, escalation protocols, and what happens when normal channels fail.

---

### 📄 [Collaboration Platform Procedure](pro-communications-collaboration-index.md)  
A practical walkthrough of which tools we use and how they work together. Covers GitHub, Pumble, Jitsi, Trello, and fallback workflows. If you're looking for “what to click” and “when to reply,” start here.

---

### 📄 [Communications Log](log-communications.md)  
A chronological record of significant communication events, decisions, requests, blockers, and escalations. Supports transparency, traceability, and stakeholder reporting.
