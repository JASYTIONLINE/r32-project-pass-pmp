# Scope Management (README)

The **Scope Management** folder defines *what* the project includes and *how* that work is governed, validated, and controlled.  
This area ensures that every deliverable in **Project PASS PMP** aligns with stakeholder expectations and is managed against a locked baseline.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose
This folder provides:
- A defined process for establishing and maintaining the **scope baseline**.  
- Tools and standards for collecting and validating requirements.  
- Cross-links to integration and change control processes.  

Together, these ensure that scope is measurable, validated, and protected from uncontrolled change.
