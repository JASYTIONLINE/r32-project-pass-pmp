# 📘 Scope Baseline Index  
**Folder:** `/10-scope-management/scope-baseline/`

## 📎 What Is the Scope Baseline?

The **Scope Baseline** represents the formally approved definition of what is and is not included in the project. It is a required component of the **Project Management Plan**, governed by PMI’s Scope Management knowledge area.

This folder contains the three core elements of the Scope Baseline:
1. The **Project Scope Statement**
2. The **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
3. The **WBS Dictionary**

Together, these documents define:
- What the project will deliver
- How the work is structured
- How each deliverable is described and controlled

These files are version-controlled and cannot be changed without an approved Change Request.

## 📂 Documents in This Folder

### 📄 [[01-project-scope-statement|Project Scope Statement]]

The [[01-project-scope-statement]] formally defines the **scope of the entire project**, including all deliverables, exclusions, constraints, assumptions, and governance rules. It outlines the dual-track delivery system: the public-facing PMP Study Knowledge Base and the internal team knowledge base. It serves as the anchor document for all planning, ensuring that team members, stakeholders, and GPT contributors understand the project's boundaries and value outcomes:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

---

### 📄 [[02-work-breakdown-structure|Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)]]

The [[02-work-breakdown-structure]] provides a **hierarchical decomposition of all project work**, grouped into major deliverables and broken down to manageable levels. It includes WBS IDs and is structured around the two delivery tracks: the study site and the internal GH knowledge base. The WBS helps organize tasks, sequence work, and assign responsibilities while aligning directly with the Scope Statement:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

### 📄 [[03-wbs-dictionary|WBS Dictionary]]

The [[03-wbs-dictionary]] defines each WBS element in detail, including its description, deliverables, owner, and any notes or dependencies. It adds essential **context and clarity** to each node in the WBS. The dictionary ensures that scope elements are fully understood and that handoffs between contributors are seamless. This document is vital for maintaining quality and governance throughout the project lifecycle:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
