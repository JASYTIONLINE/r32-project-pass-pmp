# Requirements Documentation Index  
**Folder:** `/10-scope-management/requirements/`  
**Bloom’s Level:** 1 – Remembering (Reference-Ready)

---

## Introduction

The **Requirements folder** documents how requirements are managed, tracked, and validated for the **Project PASS PMP** initiative. This folder is not part of the formal **scope baseline** but is essential to supporting scope development. It provides clear structure for the **identification, intake, traceability, and validation** of all project requirements.

Each document below supports a specific task in the lifecycle of a requirement — from initial idea through sponsor approval and mapping to deliverables. All documents are written in Markdown, version-controlled, and interlinked with other knowledge base components (e.g., ECO anchors, glossary, and scope statement).

## 📂 Documents in This Folder

### 📄 [[01-requirements-management-plan|Requirements Management Plan]]

The [[01-requirements-management-plan]] defines the overall **process** for how requirements are collected, documented, prioritized, validated, and tracked across the project lifecycle. It outlines roles and responsibilities, change protocols, and tools like the RTM. This is the central reference document that governs how all other requirement artifacts in this folder are used and maintained.

---

### 📄 [[02-requirements-traceability-matrix|Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)]]

The [[02-requirements-traceability-matrix]] is a live working matrix used to **map requirements to ECO Tasks/Enablers and deliverables**. It ensures that every requirement has a purpose, is testable, and is aligned with output. This file is critical for maintaining traceability, especially as new content is added or changes are proposed.

---

### 📄 [[03-requirements-intake-form|Requirements Intake Form]]

The [[03-requirements-intake-form]] is a standardized form used to **propose new requirements**. Anyone submitting a requirement must complete this form, identifying the ECO linkage, priority, impacted deliverables, and rationale. It feeds directly into the RTM and serves as the formal entry point for new scope elements or content features.

---

### 📄 [[04-requirements-validation-checklist|Requirements Validation Checklist]]

The [[04-requirements-validation-checklist]] is a **review tool** used by the sponsor or PM to confirm whether a requirement is ready to move forward. It checks for clarity, ECO alignment, feasibility, and traceability. Requirements that fail this checklist are either rejected or sent back for revision before inclusion in the RTM.

---

### 📄 [[00-customer-intake-interview-project-pass-pmp|Customer Intake Interview (Contextual)]]

The [[00-customer-intake-interview-project-pass-pmp]] captures the original **vision, success criteria, and planning assumptions** behind this project. While not a requirement document itself, it is included here to provide **historical context** for why the current requirements exist. It helps ensure alignment between initial goals and current deliverables.

---

## 🔁 Cross-Reference Notes

- Changes to any requirement must be approved via the [[../change-management/change-request-template|Change Request Template]].
- All approved requirements must be entered into the [[02-requirements-traceability-matrix]].
- Glossary terms arising from requirements should be added incrementally to the `510-glossary.md` file in `/500-resources/`.
