# Project Scope Management Plan

## 1. Purpose

This Scope Management Plan defines how the project scope will be **defined, validated, and controlled**.  
It establishes the framework for ensuring that all project workâ€”and only the required workâ€”is performed to complete the project successfully.

---

## 2. Scope Management Objectives

- Clearly define what is **in-scope** and **out-of-scope**  
- Establish the **Scope Baseline** (Scope Statement, WBS, WBS Dictionary)  
- Provide a structured approach for **controlling scope changes**  
- Ensure consistent understanding of project deliverables among all stakeholders  

---

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Project Manager | Develops, maintains, and controls the Scope Management Plan |
| Project Sponsor | Reviews and approves the final scope and any major changes |
| Project Team | Participates in defining deliverables and WBS decomposition |
| Stakeholders | Validate scope through formal acceptance criteria |

---

## 4. Scope Definition Process

1. Collect requirements from stakeholders  
2. Define the detailed project scope  
3. Develop the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  
4. Validate scope with stakeholders  
5. Control scope using the approved baseline  

Each step contributes to establishing a **clear and traceable scope baseline**.

---

## 5. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The WBS decomposes the project deliverables into manageable components.  
- The **WBS** and **WBS Dictionary** together form the structure for tracking scope, schedule, and cost.  
- The WBS should be deliverable-oriented and reflect all approved project work.

---

## 6. Scope Baseline Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Project Scope Statement** | Detailed narrative describing project deliverables, exclusions, and acceptance criteria |
| **WBS** | Hierarchical decomposition of project deliverables |
| **WBS Dictionary** | Detailed description of each work package |

---

## 7. Scope Validation

Scope validation is the process of obtaining **formal acceptance** of completed deliverables from the customer or sponsor.  
Validation occurs at key milestones or upon completion of deliverables.

**Methods may include:**
- Inspections or walkthroughs  
- Deliverable reviews  
- Sign-off on acceptance forms  

---

## 8. Scope Control

Scope control involves monitoring the project and managing changes to the scope baseline.  
All requested changes must follow the **Integrated Change Control Process**.

### Control Steps:
1. Identify a potential change  
2. Document the change request  
3. Evaluate impact on scope, schedule, cost, and risk  
4. Submit for approval through Change Control Board (CCB)  
5. Update the scope baseline if approved  

---

## 9. Tools and Techniques

- Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)  
- Work Breakdown Structure templates  
- Change Request Log  
- Stakeholder analysis tools  

---

## 10. Scope Change Process

All changes to project scope must be:
- Logged in the Change Request Log  
- Evaluated for impacts  
- Approved before implementation  

Only **approved changes** become part of the updated scope baseline.

---

## 11. Assumptions and Constraints

**Assumptions:**  
- Stakeholder requirements are complete and accurate  
- Deliverables can be validated against documented acceptance criteria  

**Constraints:**  
- Budget or resource limits  
- Fixed delivery dates  
- Regulatory or compliance restrictions  

---

## 12. Deliverables

| Deliverable | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Example Deliverable 1 | Description here | Acceptance criteria here |
| Example Deliverable 2 | Description here | Acceptance criteria here |

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Keep this plan updated throughout the project. Any changes to the scope baseline should trigger a review and re-approval process to maintain project control.
