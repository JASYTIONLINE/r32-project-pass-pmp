## PMBOK in the ECO World  

This section is about the **core concepts PMI expects you to know from the PMBOK Guide**, reframed through the lens of the **Exam Content Outline (ECO)**.  

PMBOK provides the structure: terminology, baselines, and process awareness. The ECO asks: *Can you apply it in a scenario?*  

Think of PMBOK as your **map** — it shows you the terrain. ECO is your **journey** — it asks if you can navigate the terrain when it shifts.

## What This Section Covers  

Here’s what you’ll find in the PMBOK section of this knowledge base:  

- **[[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/02-pmbok/01-stakeholder|Stakeholders]]**  
  Every project begins and ends with people. Stakeholders shape priorities, create momentum, or block progress. This page shows you how to recognize, engage, and balance their influence — both in the real world and on the exam.  

- **[[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/02-pmbok/02-risk|Risk]]**  
  Risk isn’t just about what can go wrong — it’s about what can change. This page explains why PMI sees risk as both a threat and an opportunity, and how you’ll be tested on proactive vs reactive behavior.  

- **[[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/02-pmbok/03-eef-opa|EEFs & OPAs]]**  
  Projects don’t happen in a vacuum. Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs) and Organizational Process Assets (OPAs) are the context you inherit. This page helps you spot exam traps where the difference between “environment” and “asset” matters.  

- **[[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/02-pmbok/04-change|Change]]**  
  Change is inevitable. The exam won’t ask if change is good or bad — it’ll test if you handled it correctly. This page gives you PMI’s view of how change shapes projects and what disciplined handling looks like.  

- **[[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/02-pmbok/05-tailoring|Tailoring]]**  
  One size never fits all. Tailoring is how you adapt PM practices to context without losing control. This page shows how PMI embeds tailoring into every ECO domain and why “adaptive, not arbitrary” is the right exam mindset.

## Why This Matters for the Exam  

On the PMP exam, you won’t just be asked to define these concepts. You’ll face scenarios that force you to choose:  
- Which stakeholder matters most right now?  
- Is this issue a risk, or already a problem?  
- Is the factor you’re seeing an EEF or an OPA?  
- Should you implement this change — or log, analyze, and escalate it?  
- Is the best move to follow process rigidly, or tailor it to fit context?  

These aren’t trivia questions. They’re judgment calls. This section helps you build the instincts PMI rewards.
