## What this page is about  
This page breaks down the **PMI Exam Content Outline (ECO)** — the official blueprint used by PMI
to structure the PMP® exam. 

While the *PMBOK® Guide* explains what project management is, the ECO defines how it will be tested. The ECO organizes the exam around **three performance domains**: *People*, *Process*, and *Business Environment*. Each domain contains **tasks**, which describe responsibilities of project managers, and **enablers**, which illustrate how those tasks show up in practice.

Understanding the ECO helps you:
- Know what PMI expects you to *do* as a project manager  
- Recognize the logic behind situational questions  
- Build confidence for exam scenarios  

For definitions of terms used on this page, refer to the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary|Glossary]].

## Exam Content Breakdown  
PMI divides the PMP exam into three **domains** with associated **tasks** and **enablers**:

---
### Domain I: People (42% of the exam)  
Focus: Leading and supporting individuals and teams  
This domain evaluates your soft skills, leadership, and interpersonal effectiveness.  

**Key Tasks Include:**  
- [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Manage Conflict|Manage Conflict]]
- Lead a team  
- Support team performance  
- Empower team members and stakeholders  
- Ensure team collaboration and engagement  
- Build a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#shared-understanding|Shared Understanding]] 
- Engage and support virtual teams  
- Mentor relevant stakeholders  
- Promote team performance through emotional intelligence  

PMI highly values [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Emotional intelligence|Emotional intelligence]], servant [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Leadership|Leadership]], and team [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Collaboration|Collaboration]].

---
### Domain II: Process (50% of the exam)  
Focus: Technical project management  
This domain measures your ability to apply processes, methods, and tools to achieve project outcomes.  

**Key Tasks Include:**  
- Execute project with urgency  
- Manage communications  
- Assess and manage [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Risk|Risk]]  
- Engage stakeholders  
- Plan and manage scope, budget, and schedule  
- Integrate project planning activities  
- Manage [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Quality|Quality]] and project artifacts  
- Use appropriate [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Procurement|Procurement]] and delivery approaches  
- Manage project issues and knowledge transfer  

 Expect many questions about planning, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Tailoring|Tailoring]], [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Change control|Change control]], [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Quality|Quality]], and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Value delivery|Value delivery]].

---
[[#PMI Exam Content Outline|Top]]
### Domain III: Business Environment (8% of the exam)  
Focus: Aligning project work with organizational strategy  
This domain tests your awareness of the project’s broader context and your ability to deliver lasting impact.  

**Key Tasks Include:**  
- Plan and manage project compliance  
- Evaluate and deliver project benefits and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Business value|Business value]]  
- Support organizational [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Change management|Change management]]  
- Contribute to [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Strategic alignment|Strategic alignment]]  

Look for mentions of [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Strategic alignment|Strategic alignment]], compliance, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Business value|Business value]], and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Change management|Change management]].

## Applying Project Management Principles in Practice  

The ECO is principle-informed — it doesn't test memorization of the PMBOK. Instead, it expects you to apply **PMI's 12 Project Management Principles** in the context of real-world work.

Here’s how PMI’s domains map back to the principles:

| ECO Domain           | Principle Focus Examples                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| People               | Collaboration, Leadership, Stewardship, Adaptability             |
| Process              | Quality, Risk, Tailoring, Value Focus                            |
| Business Environment | Stewardship, Value Delivery, Change Enablement, Systems Thinking |

### Scenario Example:  
 You’re leading a cross-functional team with remote members. A team member frequently misses stand-ups and deliverables. What should you do?

Principles at play:  
- Foster collaboration and shared understanding (People)  
- Adapt leadership to context and support team performance (People)  
- Resolve issues constructively using [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Emotional intelligence|Emotional intelligence]] (People)  

Best answer: Engage directly, clarify expectations, and coach the team member while maintaining transparency with the team.

## How the ECO Drives the Exam  

- Every PMP exam question is tied to a **task and enabler** from the ECO.  
- Most questions are **situational** — testing your judgment, not rote memory.  
- The exam integrates [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Agile|Agile]], [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Adaptive|Adaptive]], and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Predictive|Predictive]] concepts across all domains.  
- You won’t see questions labeled by domain — PMI blends them seamlessly.

### Examples of Enabler Logic  
**Task: Assess and manage [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Risk|Risk]]**  
Enablers may involve:  
- Anticipating risk triggers  
- Using a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Risk register|Risk register]]  
- Communicating risks proactively  

**Task: Lead a team**  
Enablers may involve:  
- Resolving conflict constructively  
- Promoting team [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Empowerment|Empowerment]]  
- Supporting decision-making

## Using the ECO to Guide Study Strategy  

To optimize your exam prep:

- **Start with the domains** — understand what PMI expects you to *do*.  
- **Use tasks and enablers** as behavior-based goals in your studies.  
- **Connect each domain** back to [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/01-test-prep/03-principles|Project management principles]].  
- Use ECO-based mock questions that test *how you think*, not just what you know.  
- Review the ECO regularly — it’s your mental checklist on exam day.

- For question practice that mirrors the ECO framework, we recommend [PMI StudyHall](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/certification-resources/pmi-study-hall?utm_source_misc=examsimulator_PMP)
