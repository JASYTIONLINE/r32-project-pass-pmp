# 05 Closing The Plan

*Closing Process Group — Accepted Work Order*

The **Closing Process Group** formally completes the project or a phase and transfers the final product, service, or result to operations or the requesting organization. During Closing, we confirm the work has been completed to standard, the definition of success has been met, and formal acceptance is secured. 

Most importantly, this is also where resources tied up in the project are released: human resources return to their home teams, funds earmarked for the effort are reconciled, and capital assets (such as computers or equipment) are relinquished. Closing is also where the team consolidates lessons learned and archives project information for audit, knowledge reuse, and organizational learning. 

Closing is not a “nice-to-have.” Without it, teams can drift from one effort to the next with no clear handoff, open contracts, unresolved documentation, and missed opportunities to improve. A disciplined closeout provides clarity for stakeholders, financial accuracy for the organization, and actionable insights for future projects.

## Key Processes in the Closing Group

According to PMI, the Closing Process Group includes the following processes

1. **Confirm [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#acceptance|Final Acceptance]] — Obtain formal sign-off from the #### [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#authorized|authorized customer/sponsor.]]  
2. **Close Project or Phase** — Complete financials, archive documents, update assets, and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#release resources|release resources.]]  
3. [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#procurement|Close Procurements]] — Verify all contracts are completed, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#deliverable|deliverables]] #### [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#acceptance|accepted,]] and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#obligation|obligations]] are met.  
4. **Capture and Share** [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#lessons learned|lessons learned]] — Document what worked, what didn’t, and recommendations for the future.

## [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#acceptance|Acceptance, ]][[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#handover|Handover,]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#lessons learned|and Learning]]

Successful Closing requires clear [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#acceptance criteria|Acceptance Criteria]]  —defined in [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/2-planning|Planning]] and verified during [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/3-executing|Executing]] and [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/4-monitor-control|Monitoring & Controlling.]] Handover to operations (or the customer) should be planned, with training, access, and support arrangements documented.  

Lessons learned should be gathered from the entire stakeholder set, not just the core team, and stored where they can be discovered and reused by others.

## Example in Practice

In CMPA 3302, Closing happens when we actually submit the documents and deliverables created during the week to Canvas for the instructor to grade. The project is not over until the instructor accepts the submission, evaluates it against the rubric, and provides feedback. Only then is final acceptance secured.  

Afterward, we capture lessons learned—what worked, what didn’t—and apply them to planning for the next week so the same mistakes aren’t repeated.  

Closing also involves deciding what to do with project artifacts: transcripts, notes, drafts, or working files. These may be designated as trash and discarded, or formally archived for retrieval when useful later.  

Just finishing the product or deliverables does not close the project; there are multiple steps—submission, acceptance, feedback, lessons learned, and archival—that must be completed before the project can truly be terminated.
