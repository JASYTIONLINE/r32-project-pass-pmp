 ## Stakeholder Engagement Builds Trust

 ![image of stakeholder engagement](jasytionline.github.io/assets/images/modules/stake.jpg)]]
*A detailed customer request is key to establishing a strong charter and plan.*

Although not officially one of the 5 PMP [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/100-published/110-modules/03-lifecycle/index|Process Groups]] it would be remiss not to include the pre-project requirements that must be satisfied before a project can be established. These prerequisites form the foundation on which the entire effort is built. Specifically, the [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/1-Initiating|Initiating Phase]] of the Project cannot begin until these are met; without them, any attempt to plan or execute is likely to fail.  

The first step is to establish the relationship of trust between all stakeholders* and define the true needs of the sponsor and customer. If the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary### Project Management Plan|Project Management Plan]] is the road we’ll travel, the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Business Case|business case]] and the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Project Charter|project charter]] define the destination—because if we don’t know where we’re going, any road will do.

## Key Activities Before Initiation

1. Engage [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Stakeholder|Stakeholders]] and establish trust.  
   Building trust through early engagement ensures the customer feels heard, and the project team gains clarity about needs and expectations.  

2. Capture and document the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#customer request|customer request.]]  
   Translate initial wants into a clear, documented request that reflects the customer’s true |intent.  
3. Work with [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Stakeholder|stakeholders]] to formalize the request into a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Business Case|business case]] 
   The business case outlines the benefits costs, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Risk|risks,]] and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Strategic Alignment|strategic alignment,]] providing the foundation for deciding whether a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Project|project]] should move forward.  

4. Identify the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#sponsor|sponsor]] or [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Authority|authority.]]  
   Determine who has the organizational power and Financial Responsibility to autorize the project.  

5. Assess resource availability.  
   Verify that funding, staffing, and materials are realistically available to support the project if approved.  

6. Secure business case approval.  
   The business case must be endorsed by the sponsor or governing body. This approval provides the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Justification|justification]] needed to advance the idea into a formal project.  

> Once the business case is approved, the project can move into the [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/1-Initiating|Initiation phase]], where the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Project Charter|project charter]] is created and formally authorizes [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/2-planning|Planning to begin.]]

## Stakeholder Engagement and the Business Case

The [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Customer Request|customer request]] is the basis of any project. Before a project can move forward, the team must understand the customer’s *true intent*.  

Often, customers do not fully understand what they need — they only know what they want. By engaging stakeholders early, the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Project Manager|project manager]] or [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Sponsor|sponsor]] can validate what the customer actually needs versus what they initially asked for.  

The fastest way to introduce failure into a project is by skipping this step. Taking time to interview stakeholders helps the team uncover the true problem to be solved and clarify the definition of success from the customer’s perspective. Once this dialogue is complete, the request can be formalized into a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Business Case|business case.]]  

This is especially important when the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Customer|customer]] is not the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#sponsor|sponsor.]] In those situations, a clear and comprehensive business case is essential to [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Justification|justify]] the project to the sponsor — who usually bears the most financial risk.  

If the business case is missing critical elements:  
- Does not reflect the customer’s [[#Example in Practice|true need]]  
- Fails to justify the project  
- Ignores high-level risks  

The sponsor may approve or deny the project based on faulty information.

*“It is necessary for the Project Team to listen to the customer, determine the needs, and fully understand who is going to use the product or service.”* — PMI, *Defining the Needs of the Customer in Terms of the Project* ([pmi.org](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/defining-needs-customer-terms-project-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## Example in Practice

Earlier in my career as a car salesman, it was common for customers to walk onto the lot asking for a two-door convertible sports car. But through careful questioning, I often discovered they were buying for a family of five with three kids and a dog who needed room for soccer weekends.  

Had I simply sold them the sports car, I would have delivered what they *asked for*, but not what they *needed*.  

The same is true in projects: if the team accepts the initial request without stakeholder engagement, the deliverables may be produced, but the **intent** and **need** remain unmet. True success comes from uncovering the real problem and ensuring the business case reflects it.
