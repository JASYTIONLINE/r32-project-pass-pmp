# Project PASS PMP Case Study

Every project begins as a spark.  
This one became a living study in how a team turns process into progress.  
From the first sketch of an idea to a published, working knowledge base, **Project PASS PMP** captures the full rhythm of professional project management in motion.

Each page inside this case study shows what that looked like: the decisions, trade-offs, risks, and wins that shaped the journey. You’ll see the same structure used in the *PMP® Exam Prep Workbook v3.2* and the **ECO**, but here it’s not theory — it’s evidence.

## Why It Matters

Project PASS PMP isn’t just a site about studying for an exam.  
It’s proof that the same frameworks used to earn certification can be used to build something that lasts.  
Each section invites you to see those ideas come alive — one plan, one risk log, one decision at a time.
