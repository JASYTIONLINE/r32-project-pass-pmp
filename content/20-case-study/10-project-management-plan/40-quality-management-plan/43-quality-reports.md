Quality Reports aim to:
- Consolidate findings from QA/QC reviews and audits.  
- Track nonconformities, defects, and corrective actions.  
- Measure improvement progress and quality performance trends.  
- Provide documented evidence for retrospectives and audits.  
- Communicate results to stakeholders and inform the **Continuous Improvement Plan (44)**.
