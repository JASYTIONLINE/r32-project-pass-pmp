# Schedule Management Plan  
**Project:** Project PASS PMP  
**Folder:** `/20-schedule-management/`

---

## 1. Purpose

This plan defines how the schedule for **Project PASS PMP** will be:
- Developed  
- Sequenced  
- Monitored  
- Controlled  
- Reported

It supports timely delivery and transparency throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## 2. Schedule Planning Approach

Scheduling will follow a **rolling wave approach**:
- High-level milestones established early
- Detailed task planning done progressively
- Dependencies and durations recorded in the [Detailed Project Schedule](02-detailed-project-schedule.md)

---

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Sponsor | Approves milestones and baselines |
| Project Manager | Owns the schedule; tracks updates and reports performance |
| Content Developers | Update task status, provide time estimates |
| Contributors | Follow task dates, raise delays early |

---

## 4. Tools and Formats

- **Tool:** Obsidian for schedule planning in Markdown  
- **Format:** Markdown tables and performance logs  
- **Backup Format:** CSV export (if needed for conversion)

---

## 5. Schedule Components

This project uses the following schedule-related artifacts:

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [[02-detailed-project-schedule]] | Full list of scheduled tasks and durations |
| [[03-milestone-list]] | Key delivery checkpoints |
| [[04-schedule-baseline]] | Locked schedule baseline for performance tracking |
| [[05-schedule-change-log.md]] | Approved changes to the baseline |
| [[06-schedule-performance-report.md]] | SPI, variance, and actual vs. planned metrics |

---

## 6. Schedule Baseline

The [Schedule Baseline](04-schedule-baseline.md) is the approved version of the full project schedule.  
It will be used to measure performance and cannot be changed without an approved [Change Request](../00-project-integration-management/change-management/change-request-template.md).

---

## 7. Schedule Control and Change Management

All changes to the schedule baseline must be:
1. Logged in the [Schedule Change Log](./05-schedule-change-log.md)  
2. Reviewed for impact on scope and cost  
3. Approved by the Sponsor

---

## 8. Performance Reporting

Performance will be monitored using:
- **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**
- **Planned vs. Actual Completion**
- **Milestone tracking**

See: [Schedule Performance Report](./06-schedule-performance-report.md)

---

## 9. Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Milestone sequence follows Simplilearn pacing  
- Sponsor reviews schedule weekly  
- GitHub commits reflect actual work status

### Constraints
- Weekly publishing deadlines  
- Time-limited review windows  
- No full-time team members; contributors are part-time

---

## 10. Approval

| Name     | Role             | Signature | Date |
|----------|------------------|-----------|------|
| Sponsor  | Project Owner     |           |      |
| PM       | Schedule Manager  |           |      |

---

> This plan defines the rules and artifacts for scheduling across the full project lifecycle. All contributors should understand how scheduling affects deliverables, dependencies, and final exam preparation timelines.
