# Requirements Management (README)

The **Requirements Management** folder defines how stakeholder needs evolve into verified, testable project requirements within **Project PASS PMP**.  
This section bridges the gap between the **Scope Baseline** (what is promised) and the **Integration Management** processes (how it all fits together).

PMI defines requirement management as the process of ensuring that project requirements are gathered, documented, and validated systematically.  
This folder captures every artifact needed to meet that expectation and maintain traceability from **intake → documentation → validation**.

---

## 📘 Purpose
This folder exists to:
- Provide a **repeatable structure** for defining, managing, and validating requirements.  
- Ensure every stakeholder expectation is **captured, traceable, and approved** before work begins.  
- Link the scope baseline to measurable validation criteria for exam-ready project governance.  

Together, these documents ensure that no requirement is lost, duplicated, or misinterpreted across the life of the project.

## 🔗 Relationship to Other Folders
- **Integration Management:** ensures all requirement artifacts align to the master project plan.  
- **Scope Baseline:** defines boundaries and deliverables that requirements must satisfy.  
- **Quality Management:** later verifies that validated requirements meet acceptance standards.  
- **Glossary:** supports consistent terminology for requirement types and attributes.

---

## ⚙️ Usage
Use these documents when:
- Defining **what the project must deliver** to satisfy stakeholder goals.  
- Creating traceable relationships between project goals, deliverables, and validation methods.  
- Preparing artifacts for the PMP exam to illustrate real-world requirement control examples.

This folder acts as the “single source of truth” for requirement-related documentation.
