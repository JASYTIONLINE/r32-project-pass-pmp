# Scope Management – Document Index  
**Folder:** `/10-project-management-plan/10-scope-management/`  
**Bloom’s Level:** 1 – Remembering (Reference Ready)

## 📎 Overview

This folder documents all practices, plans, and baselined artifacts related to **Project Scope Management**. It supports the planning, tracking, and control of project scope through the entire lifecycle of Project PASS PMP.

The contents are divided into:
- **Scope Planning artifacts** (how scope is managed and requirements are handled)
- **Baselined scope documents** (Scope Statement, WBS, WBS Dictionary)
- **Subfolders** for logical separation of **baseline** and **requirements** documentation
