# ðŸ“¦ Procurement Management Plan â€“ Project PASS PMP  
**Folder:** `/80-procurement-management-plan/`

---

## Purpose

This plan defines how the project will manage procurement of tools, subscriptions, third-party content, or services. It includes decision criteria, roles, documentation requirements, and control mechanisms.

---

## What This Covers

- Licensing (e.g., GitHub, plugins, publishing tools)  
- Subcontracted writing, editing, or design support  
- Paid training resources or databases  
- Hosted services or publishing platforms (if not internally managed)

---

## Procurement Approach

- **Internal first** â€” if the team can fulfill the need  
- **Buy over build** â€” for non-differentiated tools  
- **Approval required** â€” for anything with monetary cost or license risk  
- **Vendor-neutral** â€” selections made on need, not preference

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| PM | Initiates requests, documents approvals |
| Sponsor | Final decision authority |
| Requester | Provides justification and benefit |
| Technical Lead | Assesses integration or system impact |

---

## Decision Criteria

- Alignment to scope  
- Licensing restrictions or support needs  
- Cost vs. benefit  
- Risk (data access, vendor reliability)  
- Internal alternatives
