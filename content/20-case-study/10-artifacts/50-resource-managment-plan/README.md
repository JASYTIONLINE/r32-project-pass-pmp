## What This Folder Covers

This folder defines how the people involved in Project PASS PMP are organized, assigned, supported, and tracked. It covers roles, availability, effort estimates, norms, and development needs.

Everything in here exists to make sure the right people are working on the right things at the right time — and that they know how to work together.
