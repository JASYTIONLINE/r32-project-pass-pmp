## [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Initiating Process Group|Initiating Process Group]]
The initiating Process Group is the collection of [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#process|processes]] performed to formally start a new [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project|project]] or a new phase of an existing project. It ensures that a project’s purpose is clearly defined, that [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#authorization|authorization]] is granted, and that the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project manager|project manager]] has the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#authority|authority]] to apply organizational resources.

Unlike the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Initiating Phase|initiating phase]], which is a time-boxed stage, the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Initiating Process Group|Initiating Process Group]] is a recurring set of [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#process|processes.]] Every phase of a project may begin with activities from this group to validate objectives, realign stakeholder expectations, and reconfirm business value.

## [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Key Process|Key Processes]] in the Initiating Group
According to PMI, the Initiating Process Group centers on two core processes

1. **Develop Project Charter** – [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Authorize|Authorizes]] the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project|project]] and names the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project manager|project manager.]] The Project Charter must be approved by the Project Sponsor in order for the project to go forward.  
2. **Identify Stakeholders** – Is the process we use to [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Stakeholder Registry|document who is affected, their interests, and their influence]] on the project. Not every stakeholder will be identified at this time; often, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#role|duty positions]] are listed rather than named individuals.

> *“The purpose of the Initiating Process Group is to align stakeholders’ expectations with the project’s purpose, give them visibility about the* *[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#scope|scope]]* and *[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Objective|objectives]], and show how their participation can help achieve those expectations.”* — PMBOK® Guide, 6th Ed.

## Example in Practice
A software project may begin with a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Charter|charter]] signed by the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#CIO|CIO]], authorizing the project manager to begin. At the same time, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder|stakeholders]] are identified — [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#executive|executives]], [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#End User|end users]], [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#IT|IT staff]], and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#vendor|vendors.]]  

By capturing this list early, the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project team|Project Team]] can plan effective communication strategies in the next process group, Planning. Even though the charter is not yet signed, preliminary work must be completed to identify the five W’s of the project to give the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#sponsor|sponsor]] enough information to make an informed decision.
