# [Character Name] â€“ Story Engine & Structural Backstory

## ðŸ”§ How to Use [Name]â€™s Backstory
Explain how this backstory should be **used in story development** â€” not as exposition, but as a pressure system that drives decisions, hesitations, behaviors, and growth. Include notes about emotional tone, character tension, or hidden truth.

---

## ðŸ§  [Name]â€™s Backstory (In-World Truth)
Write a full narrative of their backstory **as if it's canon** â€” not a resume. This is what really happened, even if no one knows it yet. Give emotional stakes, key past events, and how they got where they are when the story begins.

---

##  How to Leak the Backstory (Narrative Integration)
Detail **how to reveal** this backstory across the narrative without exposition dumps. Use:
- Behavioral patterns
- Dialogue (jokes, friction, half-truths)
- Environmental echoes
- Systemic callbacks or repeated language
- Near-reveals or deliberate silences

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Moment â€” The Emotional Payoff
Describe the **one scene** where this character finally confronts, accepts, or reveals their backstory â€” and how it transforms their role, relationships, or arc. This is the *emotional release* of all that buried tension.
