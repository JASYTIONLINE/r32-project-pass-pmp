# Quality Checklists  
**Project PASS PMP**

---

## 1. Purpose  

This document defines the **standard quality verification checklists** used to confirm that each deliverable within the Project PASS PMP teaching website meets established requirements for accuracy, completeness, readability, and compliance.  

Checklists create consistency. They prevent oversight, reinforce standards, and ensure that ‚Äúquality‚Äù is verified, not assumed.

> **PMI Principle Alignment:**  
> Checklists operationalize *Manage Quality* (QA) and *Control Quality* (QC) in PMBOK 6 and support ECO 2021 **Domain 2 ‚Äî Process** and **Domain 3 ‚Äî Business Environment**.

---

## 2. Checklist Governance  

All checklists are approved and maintained by the **Writers Room Governance Team**.  
They are updated after each improvement cycle per the **Continuous Improvement Plan (44)** and integrated into workflows through the **Quality Management Plan (40)**.

Checklists serve three purposes:
1. **Prevention** ‚Äì ensure required standards are addressed before publishing.  
2. **Verification** ‚Äì confirm deliverables meet acceptance criteria.  
3. **Documentation** ‚Äì provide audit trails for quality assurance reports.
