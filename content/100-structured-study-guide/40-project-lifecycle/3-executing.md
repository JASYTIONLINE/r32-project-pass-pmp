# Executing The Plan

*Executing relies on coordinated teamwork, strong communication, and continuous stakeholder engagement to produce deliverables. The executing phase is where the actual deliverables are created. Up until this point all lines of effort are focused on scaffolding.*

The **Executing Process Group** is where the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Project Management Plan|plan]] becomes action—and action becomes [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Deliverable|deliverables.]]The [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Project Manager|Project Manager]] and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Project Team|Project Team]] coordinate people, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#resource|resources]], and vendors to perform the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#WBS|work defined]] in the plan, while the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Communications Plan|communications plan]] keeps everyone informed. The risk management plan puts response mechanisms in place so anticipated risks can be handled if they become events, and execution remains aligned with [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/4-monitor-control|Monitoring and Controlling]] to help keep deliverables on time and to standard.  

Executing is also where [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Servant Leadership|servant leadership]] and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Stakeholder Engagement|stakeholder engagement]] matter most: progress depends on clear direction, timely decisions, and removing roadblocks so the team can do its best work.

While [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/2-planning|Planning]] defines *what* needs to be done and *how*, Executing focuses on doing the work, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Managing Performance|managing performance,]] and maintaining [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#alignment|alignment]] with the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#baseline|baselines]] established in [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/2-planning|Planning.]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Issue|Issues]] discovered here are communicated and, when necessary, routed back through [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/4-monitor-control|Monitoring & Controlling]] to request [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Change|changes]] or [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Corrective Actions|corrective actions.]]

## [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Key Process|Key Processes]] in the Executing Group

According to PMI, the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Execution Process Group|Executing Process Group]] includes the following processes:

1. **Direct and Manage Project Work** — Perform the work to produce deliverables.  
2. **Manage Quality** — Apply planned quality activities to verify processes and prevent defects.  
3. **Acquire, Develop, and Manage Team** — Build capability, resolve conflicts, and maintain performance.  
4. **Manage Communications** — Ensure the right information reaches the right stakeholders at the right time.  
5. **Manage Stakeholder Engagement** — Maintain buy-in, address concerns, and sustain support.  
6. [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Procurement|Manage Procurements]] - Work with [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Vendor|vendors]] to deliver contracted [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Scope|scope.]]  

> *[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Execution Process Group|Execution]] turns plans into [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#deliverable|deliverables.]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Servant Leadership|Leadership,]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Communicate|communication,]] and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Stakeholder Engagement|Stakeholder Engagement]] turn deliverables into [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Value|value.]] Adapted from PMI guidance*

## Managing Teams and Communications

Executing is a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#people centric|people centric]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#process group|process group.]] The project manager enables [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Performance|performance]] by clarifying [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Expectation|expectations,]] protecting the team’s focus, and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Escalation|escalating]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Blocker|blockers]] early. Communications are proactive and purposeful: [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Status|status,]] decisions, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Risk,risks]] and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Change|changes]] are routed to the correct audiences through agreed channels and cadences in accordance with the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Communications Plan|Communications Management Plan]].  

[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Quality|Quality]] is built in—not just inspected at the end—by following defined processes and using feedback loops to prevent [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Defect|defects]] and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Rework|rework.]]

## Example in Practice

In most college courses, the Executing Process Group is where the **weekly assignments and to-do list** [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#WBS|(work breakdown structure)]] gets executed to produce completed assignments [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary### Deliverable|(Deliverables.)]] The work defined during [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/2-planning|Planning]]—such as creating rubrics and organizing one's priority list is carried out step by step using the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#Workflow|workflow]]  that matches the project’s [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#WBS|WBS]]

Draft documents are developed into final submissions and prepared to submission to the instructor. Execution also includes quality activities: drafts are reviewed against the rubric, refined, and re-checked through [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/4-monitor-control|Monitoring & Controlling]] to confirm accuracy, completeness, and compliance. By following the execution checklist, every deliverable is produced, validated, and linked back to planning intent—ensuring both the project requirements and course grading standards are fully met.
