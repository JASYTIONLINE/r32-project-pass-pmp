## Planning Process Group – From Intention to Instruction

If Initiating is about permission, Planning is about precision. This is the most ITTO-heavy process group for a reason: it turns high-level intent into detailed direction. Every estimate, every schedule, every [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#plan|plan]] for scope, quality, risk, resources, procurement, and communication emerges here — not just as a theory, but as a **coordinated set of documents and baselines** ready for execution.

The Planning ITTOs don’t live in isolation. They live in context. Together, they form the *blueprint* of how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. They respond to [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder engagement|stakeholder]] needs, organizational constraints, and delivery methods — predictive, agile, or hybrid.

This page walks through the Planning processes one by one, explaining how ITTOs show up, interact, and build toward a full project management plan. Don’t memorize. Read for understanding. The patterns will take you further than the lists ever could.

## Plan Scope Management and Collect Requirements

Planning begins with boundaries. In Plan Scope Management, you define how the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project|project]] will define and control scope. In Collect Requirements, you gather the raw material for what the project must deliver — from stakeholders, regulations, contracts, and strategic goals.

Inputs here include business documents, the project charter, and enterprise environmental factors (EEFs), which all influence how flexible or strict your [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#scope|scope]] will need to be. Tools include workshops, interviews, and decision-making techniques to ensure you surface not just *what* [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder engagement|stakeholders]] want, but *why*. Outputs like the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#requirements|requirements]] documentation and traceability matrix create a clear line between input and outcome — a chain that can be validated later in delivery.

Together, these processes set the foundation for all future planning: if your [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#scope|scope]] and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#requirements|requirements]] are misaligned, your estimates, deliverables, and timeline will suffer.

---

## Define Scope and Create WBS

Once [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#requirements|requirements]] are collected, Define Scope refines them into a project-specific lens. Here, you translate vague desires into actionable features. Then, in Create WBS, you break those features down into tangible [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#deliverable|deliverables]] and work packages using a Work Breakdown Structure.

These processes pull from the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder engagement|stakeholder]] register and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#requirements|requirements]] docs. Tools like decomposition, expert judgment, and progressive elaboration help you clarify where the edges of the work really lie. The result? A scoped project — not just in idea, but in architecture. These outputs become the scaffolding for everything else: schedule, cost, quality, and risk.

---

## Plan Schedule and Cost Management

Scope is what you’re doing. Schedule and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#estimate|cost]] are how long it takes and what it will cost. Plan Schedule Management sets the rules: what methods you'll use to estimate, track, and report progress. Plan Cost Management does the same — establishing the frameworks for estimation, budgeting, and control.

ITTOs in these processes focus on guidelines and governance. You’re not building a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#schedule|schedule]] yet — you’re defining how you’ll build one. Organizational process assets (OPAs) come into play here: templates, past project data, and financial policies that inform your [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#plan|planning]] logic.

These two processes don’t create the final numbers — they create the way you’ll arrive at those numbers. They’re about meta-planning: how will we measure time and money in a way that fits our project?

---

## Define Activities, Sequence Activities, Estimate Duration, and Develop Schedule

Now the real work [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#plan|planning]] begins. Using the WBS as a foundation, you define individual activities, sequence them logically, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#estimate|estimate]] how long each will take, and combine those [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#estimate|estimates]] into a full project schedule.

ITTOs here reflect a shift: from conceptual to quantitative. You’ll use data analysis techniques (e.g. analogous, parametric, and three-point estimation), dependency mapping, and modeling tools like critical path and what-if scenarios. Outputs include the activity list, network diagram, and the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#schedule|schedule]] itself.

This is where Planning becomes predictive. You're shaping a timeline based on logic, constraint, risk, and resource availability — and turning it into a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#schedule|schedule]] you can execute against.

---

## Estimate Costs and Determine Budget

Just as time gets modeled, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#estimate|cost]] gets quantified. Estimate Costs produces detailed [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#estimate|cost]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#estimate|estimates]] using tools like reserve analysis, expert judgment, and historical data. Determine Budget takes those [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#estimate|estimates]] and aligns them with funding limits, approval thresholds, and contingency needs.

Together, they generate a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#estimate|cost]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#baseline|baseline]] — one of the most critical outputs in Planning. This [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#baseline|baseline]] becomes your measuring stick during execution and control. Missed [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#estimate|estimates]] here ripple forward as surprises, overruns, or [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#scope|scope]] reductions later.

These processes rely heavily on accurate documentation: [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#scope|scope]] baseline, schedule, and resource [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#estimate|estimates]] all feed into meaningful financial planning.

---

## Plan Quality, Plan Resource Management, and Plan Communications

These processes ask: *How will we ensure delivery meets expectations? Who will do the work? And how will we keep everyone informed along the way?*

In Plan Quality, you define standards and how you’ll test against them — using benchmark studies, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#estimate|cost]] of quality, and design for X approaches. Plan Resource Management identifies roles, responsibilities, and reporting structures. Tools like hierarchical charts, RACI matrices, and organizational theories support clarity. Plan Communications determines how [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder engagement|stakeholder]] needs will be met: what gets communicated, when, how, and to whom.

Each process produces its own [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#plan|plan]] — and together, they ensure that project delivery is not just possible, but visible and understood.

## Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses

Planning isn’t complete without forecasting uncertainty. This sequence of processes builds the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#risk|risk]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#plan|planning]] framework from identification through prioritization and response design.

Plan Risk Management sets the tone: how [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#risk|risk]] will be defined and tracked. Identify Risks gathers [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#threat|threats]] and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#opportunities|opportunities]] through interviews, checklists, and prompt lists. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis scores them by probability and impact; Quantitative Risk Analysis models them numerically, often using simulation. Finally, Plan Risk Responses decides what to do: avoid, mitigate, transfer, exploit, or accept.

The ITTOs here involve data gathering, analysis, and expert facilitation. Outputs include the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#risk|risk]] register, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#risk|risk]] report, and a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#plan|plan]] for how you’ll respond — before [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#risk|risks]] become problems.

---

## Plan Procurement Management

This process defines how the project will interact with external vendors — from what needs to be purchased, to how contracts will be structured and managed. Inputs include the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#scope|scope]] and schedule; tools include market research and make-or-buy analysis. Outputs range from the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#procurement|procurement]] management [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#plan|plan]] to bid documents and source selection criteria.

Effective [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#plan|planning]] here avoids future disputes. It ensures [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#procurement|procurement]] timelines match project needs and that vendor engagement follows organizational policy.

---

## Plan Stakeholder Engagement

This final Planning process maps how [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder engagement|stakeholder]] expectations will be managed and aligned throughout the project. It draws heavily on the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder engagement|stakeholder]] register, EEFs, and communication preferences — and uses interpersonal tools, analysis methods, and engagement models to develop a strategy.

The result is a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder engagement|stakeholder]] engagement [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#plan|plan]] — a playbook for maintaining alignment, trust, and transparency as the project unfolds.

---

## What You Should Take Away

Planning is where all the pieces begin to fit together. The ITTOs aren’t standalone facts — they are **interdependent building blocks** of project readiness. Most of them feed forward into Executing, Monitoring, and Controlling.

On the exam, you won’t be asked to list them. You’ll be shown a scenario that asks:  
> Did the project manager [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#plan|plan]] correctly for this?  

Your job is to recognize which [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#plan|planning]] outputs should exist — and whether they were applied well or missed entirely.
