# # Stakeholders

*Stakeholders aren't just a names on a chart*

## Every project begins and ends with people. 
Budgets, schedules, and deliverables are important, but they only matter because *someone* cares about them. Those *someones* are the stakeholders — the individuals and groups who are affected by what your project does (or doesn’t) deliver.  

They are the gravity field your project operates in. Some pull you forward, others hold you back, and a few drift silently in orbit until they suddenly crash into your timeline.  

Understanding who your stakeholders are, what motivates them, and how much influence they have is the difference between a plan that works on paper and a project that works in real life.  

This page starts with that big idea — projects revolve around stakeholders — and then drills into the details: who they are, why they matter, and how to recognize their influence at every stage of the project.

### What this page is about

A [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder|stakeholder]] isn’t just a name on a chart. It’s anyone with a pulse on your project — anyone who cares, notices, resists, supports, blocks, or champions. That includes [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#sponsor|sponsors]], regulators, vendors, legal, marketing, end users, and yes, the person who only hears about the project after it launches and decides to care very loudly.

They’re all part of it. Some are loud. Some are invisible. Some have all the power and none of the time. Some have no title but all the influence. You can’t manage what you don’t acknowledge.

You start by naming them. Then listening. Then tracking what they want — and when that changes. (Spoiler: it will.)

Tools: [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder-register|stakeholder register]], [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#glossary|glossary]], your own instincts, and maybe a sixth sense.

### Who stakeholders are — and why they matter

Projects run on human gravity. No matter how perfect your plan or clean your [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#gantt-chart|Gantt chart]], you still live in a tangle of opinions, reputations, incentives, and moods.

Stakeholders aren’t just boxes to check — they’re the ecosystem your project lives in. Ignore that, and you risk building something right that still lands wrong.

Support matters. So does resistance. Morale. Trust. Visibility. What people say in the meeting, and what they say after — especially in the hallway, over coffee, or in a “quick Slack thread” that lasts three days.

This is why [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder-engagement|stakeholder engagement]] isn’t extra — it’s core.

---

### Stakeholders and the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project-management-lifecycle|Project Lifecycle]]
Stakeholders don’t show up the same way twice. They evolve. 

Early in a project, they help shape it. Later, they judge it. Some drift in and out. Some step in when it’s already burning — and ask why no one told them there was smoke.

In [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#predictive|predictive]] environments, you may see them at kickoff, reviews, handoffs. In [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#agile|Agile]], they’re there all the time — reviewing, reacting, reshaping. Doesn’t matter the method: ignore them and you’ll pay for it.

A few checkpoints:
- [[jasytionline.github/100-portals/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/2-planning|Planning]]: capture voices, constraints, priorities.
- [[jasytionline.github/100-portals/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/3-executing|Execution]]: respond to feedback, raise issues, adapt.
- [[jasytionline.github/100-portals/300-pmp-modules/03-lifecycle/5-closing|Closing]]: measure impact — not just output (or how loudly people cheer at the postmortem).

Don’t just involve them. Work with them. Even the ones who only reply “per my last email.”

---

### Stakeholder Influence and Dynamics
People don’t act in isolation. 

Stakeholders are tied into webs — political, personal, departmental. That’s why their [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#influence|influence]] isn’t static. Someone silent during planning may become pivotal in deployment. Someone who championed the work may vanish when priorities shift. (Or worse, they return... with *notes*.)

This is where your job turns observational. Read the room. Watch the patterns. Spot the momentum shifts. Understand not just who’s in the org chart — but who’s in the loop.

Tools help:
- [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#power-interest-grid|Power/Interest grids]]
- [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#salience-model|Salience models]]
- [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#engagement-assessment-matrix|Engagement matrices]]
- Feedback maps ([[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#agile|Agile]])

But tools only work if you do. And sometimes, that work looks like decoding a cryptic comment in a spreadsheet at 9:47 PM.

### Stakeholder Management 
Stakeholder management isn’t a checklist. It’s a mindset. 

It is not a “task to complete” — a relationship to keep tuning. Like a group chat that never dies, except with more accountability.

The [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#pmp|PMP]] won’t ask if you know what a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder-register|stakeholder register]] is. It’ll ask what you do when a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#sponsor|sponsor]] ghosts you, or when a vocal team lead flips sides. It’s not about process. It’s about principle.

This is where you show [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#leadership|leadership]]. Not with control — with clarity.

Know when to escalate. When to wait. When to re-engage. When to let go. Stakeholder [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#alignment|alignment]] isn’t something you win — it’s something you maintain. Like trust. Or printer access.

---

### Stakeholders as a System
You can’t script this stuff. You have to think through it. 

This is why [[jasytionline.github.io/2-references#range|PMI]] pushes principle-based thinking.  In [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#pmp|PMP]] prep — and in real life — your job is to think across the room, not just down the checklist. Especially when “the room” includes three VPs, a procurement team, and that one person who always wants to change the font.  Books like *[Range](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566529/range-by-david-epstein/)* echo this — in complex systems, range and responsiveness beat rigid expertise.

### Tools that support engagement

Stakeholder tools matter. But they don’t do the work for you. The [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder-register|register]]? It’s only useful if you update it. Grids and matrices? Great for clarity — but useless if you ignore what they show you.

- [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder-register|Stakeholder Register]]
- [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#power-interest-grid|Power/Interest Grids]]
- [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#salience-model|Salience Models]]
- [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#engagement-assessment-matrix|Engagement Assessment Matrices]]
- [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#communication-management-plan|Communication Management Plans]]
- Empathy Maps, Feedback Loops ([[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#agile|Agile]])

The tools give you visibility. But clarity comes from context. From watching. From adjusting. From leading. And sometimes from rereading that passive-aggressive comment in the meeting notes... twice.

---

### So What?

Understanding [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder-engagement|stakeholder engagement]] is mindset-driven, not rule-based. That’s why [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#pmi|PMI]] cares more about how you think than what you memorize.

In the field, and on the exam, your edge comes from seeing relationships clearly — and acting with intention.

Just remember: in a world full of frameworks and buzzwords, your common sense is still your best stakeholder tool.
