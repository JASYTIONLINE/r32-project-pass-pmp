# Module 5 – Support Project Team Performance

Projects rarely fail because of bad plans—they fail because teams can’t adapt fast enough.  
This module focuses on keeping teams aligned, informed, and improving under real project pressure.

You’ll learn to diagnose issues, implement improvements, and manage change without losing rhythm or morale.  
It reflects both **Domain I – People** and **Domain II – Process**, bridging leadership and execution.
