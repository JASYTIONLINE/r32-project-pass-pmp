# Module 2 – Start the Project

Every great project begins with clarity—about who’s involved, what’s expected, and how it will unfold.  
This module moves you from concept to kickoff, helping you engage stakeholders, shape your team, and define the project’s direction.

You’ll build the foundation for communication, collaboration, and alignment that supports every phase that follows.  
These lessons align primarily with **Domain I – People** and **Domain II – Process** in the PMP Examination Content Outline.
