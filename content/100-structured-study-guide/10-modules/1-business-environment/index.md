# Lesson 1 – Business Environment  

Before a plan, before a team, there’s the *why*.  
Every project exists inside a business ecosystem — strategy, compliance, value, and culture all fighting for influence.  
Master this first, and the rest of the exam becomes logic, not memorization.  

---

## 1A – Foundation  
Learn the DNA of modern project management — predictive, adaptive, and hybrid approaches — and the language PMI uses to test understanding.  
You’ll see how every framework, from waterfall to agile, connects back to the same goal: *delivering value within a business context.*  
**Domain link:** introduces how People, Process, and Business Environment interact across the value-delivery spectrum.

---

## 1B – Strategic Alignment  
Projects don’t exist in isolation. This topic shows how to tie your project to the organization’s mission, vision, and portfolio strategy.  
You’ll learn to translate executive goals into project outcomes — the key skill PMI calls *business acumen.*  
**Domain link:** strengthens the Business Environment domain by connecting tactical work to strategic intent.

---

## 1C – Project Benefits and Value  
Here’s where you prove a project’s worth. Learn to identify, plan, and measure the benefits that justify investment.  
These are the metrics exam questions love: ROI, benefits realization, and incremental value delivery.  
**Domain link:** anchors the concept of *value delivery* that ties People and Process decisions to business results.

---

## 1D – Organizational Culture and Change Management  
Culture decides how change lands. This section trains you to read an organization’s personality and lead transformation without chaos.  
You’ll understand resistance, change frameworks, and how to adapt your leadership style to context.  
**Domain link:** shows how the People domain’s soft skills and the Process domain’s structure work inside the Business Environment you operate in.

---

## 1E – Project Governance  
Governance defines authority — who decides, who approves, and who signs off.  
Learn escalation paths, phase gates, and decision thresholds so you can keep control while respecting the system.  
**Domain link:** embeds governance into all domains: Process through control, People through accountability, and Business Environment through compliance.

---

## 1F – Project Compliance  
Compliance isn’t red tape; it’s protection.  
This topic explains how legal, ethical, and regulatory standards shape project risk and reputation.  
You’ll learn to classify compliance requirements and build them into your plans — a critical skill for real-world leadership and the exam’s scenario questions.  
**Domain link:** closes the loop on the Business Environment domain by proving that delivering value also means delivering *responsibly.*
