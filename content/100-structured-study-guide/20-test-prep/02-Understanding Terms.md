## Why Terms Matter — But Not the Way You Think  
If you've ever found yourself staring at a glossary trying to memorize terms like *artifact*, *deliverable*, or *risk register* — let me save you some time: **that’s not how you pass the PMP exam**. PMI’s exam doesn’t ask you to define terms; it asks you to **use** them in real project contexts. In Project Management, terms define what’s being tracked, delivered, escalated, or handed off. They’re the nouns of your project grammar — but their power lies in their function, not their label.

→ See [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/01-test-prep/04-eco|PMI’s Exam Content Outline]] for where these terms show up.

## Understanding in Context — Not Just Definition  
PMI doesn’t care if you can quote the glossary.  
What they’re really testing is whether you know **how** and **why** a term is used in a real scenario. You won’t get a question asking you to define *risk register*. Instead, you’ll read a scenario where risks were identified and updated, and you’ll be asked: *What document should you review next?* This is why context matters. Memorization might help you recognize terms, but **understanding function** is what gets you the correct answer.

- One answer may be “good.”  
- Another will be **“Most Right”** — because it aligns with [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/01-test-prep/03-principles|PMI principles]].

→ Use the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary|Glossary]] to learn **what the term does**, not just what it is.

## How to Actually Study Terms  
Let’s ditch the flashcard-only mindset.  
The fastest way to master terminology is to **immerse yourself in realistic scenarios** where those terms are being used. That means:
- Read PMI content in which the terms show up naturally.
- Study example questions where explanations clarify *why* one answer works better than another.
- Focus on how terms **interact** in a process — not just how they’re defined.

## Learn by Doing (and Storytelling)  
Okay, now let’s make this fun.  
To help myself (and now you), I wrote a sci-fi adventure called *[[jasytionline.github.io/contents/100-published/110-modules/tlg/index|The Last Gate]]*. Inside, you’ll find **Project Management terms used in action** — embedded in a story where roles, risks, charters, and WBS all show up. It’s meant to be a tool that makes terminology stick by making it memorable. Reading about terms in action builds fluency faster than any glossary can.

## Bottom Line  
Terms are tools — not trivia.  
If you really want to pass the PMP, don’t just memorize terms. **Understand how they show up in real project situations**. Context is everything. When the exam challenges you with two good answers, it’s not your memory that will save you — it’s your grasp of PMI’s values and how terms fit into them.
