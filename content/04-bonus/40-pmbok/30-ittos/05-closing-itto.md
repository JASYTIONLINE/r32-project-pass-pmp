## Closing Process Group – Wrapping the Work, Capturing the Wisdom

Every project ends. But how it ends — and what it leaves behind — depends on the strength of its **Closing ITTOs**.

This process group doesn’t introduce new work. It ensures that **everything planned, produced, learned, and purchased** is properly finalized. [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#contracts|Contracts]] are closed. Deliverables are confirmed. Documents are archived. And most importantly, lessons are captured for the next team, the next initiative, or the next version.

There is only one formal process here — **Close Project or Phase** — but its ITTOs do a lot of heavy lifting. They ensure you finish cleanly, with [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#accountability|Accountability]], completeness, and clarity. Below, we’ll walk through the ITTOs that live in this process — not to memorize them, but to understand the purpose they serve at the end of the project lifecycle.

## Close Project or Phase

This process exists to create [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#closure|Closure]] — operational, financial, contractual, and historical. The ITTOs you’ll find here exist to **tie up loose ends**, verify that **everything promised has been delivered**, and ensure that **organizational memory** captures what happened.

The inputs include:
- **[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project charter|Project charter]]** – to confirm the original boundaries and intent
- **Accepted deliverables** – the formal acknowledgment that work has met [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#requirements|Requirements]]
- **Project documents** – especially those related to [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#quality|Quality]], procurement, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#risk|Risk]], and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] communications
- **Business documents** – such as the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#benefits|Benefits]] management plan and business case
- **OPAs and EEFs** – especially archival [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#policies|Policies]] and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#compliance|Compliance]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#requirements|Requirements]]
- **Procurement [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#documentation|Documentation]]** – invoices, records, and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#contracts|Contracts]]

As for tools and techniques, this process leans heavily on:
- **Expert judgment** – to evaluate completeness, confirm [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#compliance|Compliance]], and ensure [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] satisfaction
- **[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#meetings|Meetings]] and reviews** – especially final [[3-glossary#[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#performance|Performance]] reviews|[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#performance|Performance]] reviews]], [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#contract|Contract]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#closure|Closure]] sessions, and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] handoff discussions
- **[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#data analysis|Data analysis]]** – to confirm project success criteria, benefit realization, and team [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#metrics|Metrics]]
- **Document analysis** – to ensure all approvals, signatures, and closeout steps are complete
- **[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#facilitation|Facilitation]]** – to help bring [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#closure|Closure]] to complex [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#vendor|Vendor]] relationships or [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] dynamics

The outputs form the project’s **final layer of [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#accountability|Accountability]]**:
- **Final report** – a structured record of what was delivered, how well it performed, and what was learned
- **[[3-glossary#[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#lessons learned|Lessons learned]] register|[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#lessons learned|Lessons learned]] register]]** – updated to include closing-phase insights, especially those involving [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#transition|Transition]], handoff, or [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#compliance|Compliance]]
- **Final product, service, or result [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#transition|Transition]]** – confirming that [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#ownership|Ownership]] has been transferred and the project team is no longer [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#responsible|Responsible]]
- **Updates to OPAs** – archiving all records, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#documentation|Documentation]], and knowledge for future reuse

Some projects will also include **formal release of team members**, **contractor demobilization**, and **[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#audit|Audit]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#compliance|Compliance]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#reports|Reports]]** depending on industry and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#regulatory|Regulatory]] [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#needs|Needs]].

## What You Should Take Away

Closing isn’t just paperwork. It’s protection — for the team, for the organization, and for future projects. The ITTOs here ensure nothing gets lost in the final handoff, that every [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#commitment|Commitment]] is fulfilled, and that knowledge doesn’t disappear with the team.

On the exam, clues you’re in the Closing group might include:
- The deliverables have been accepted
- The sponsor is ready to sign off
- Procurement [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#needs|Needs]] to be finalized
- Knowledge [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#needs|Needs]] to be packaged or archived

This is your last chance to document, verify, and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#transition|Transition]]. If it didn’t get captured here, it probably never will.

## Questions Worth Exploring

- What happens if [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#lessons learned|Lessons learned]] are captured but not shared?
- Why is a formal [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#transition|Transition]] of deliverables critical to project [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#closure|Closure]]?
- How do procurement records [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#influence|Influence]] closing activities?
- What OPAs are typically updated during project closeout?
