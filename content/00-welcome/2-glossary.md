### Actual Cost
#### AC
##### Definition:
The *realized* cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a specific time period.  
##### Context:
Actual Cost is exactly what it sounds like: how much money you’ve *actually* spent. It’s not a plan, and it’s not earned — it’s just what has been paid. Unlike [[#Planned Value|Planned Value (PV)]] and [[#Earned Value|Earned Value (EV)]], which are about expectations or progress, AC is the raw number pulled from your financial records. If you see: “How much did we spend so far?”, you’re talking about AC. Because it reflects *only completed work*, it’s also key in [[#variance]] and [[#forecasting]] metrics like [[#CPI|CPI]] and [[#EAC|EAC]].
##### Exam cue:  
> You’re asked how much has been ***spent so far*** on a task or phase. Don't confused *Actual Cost* with planned budget or work completed. The correct answer is usually ***Actual Cost (AC)***, because that’s the number that reflects actual *expenses incurred.*

### Accepted Deliverables  
**Definition.** Accepted deliverables are those outputs  
that have been formally approved through the **Validate Scope** process.  
They meet the defined acceptance criteria and are signed off  
by the customer, sponsor, or relevant stakeholder.  
Once accepted, they are handed off for closure, integration, or deployment.

> **Exam cue.** Don’t confuse **accepted deliverables** with “verified” ones.  
Verification (via **Control Quality**) checks technical correctness;  
acceptance (via **Validate Scope**) checks customer satisfaction.  
If acceptance criteria aren’t met, deliverables are not accepted  
and may trigger a change request, rework, or escalation.  
Accepted deli[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-validate-scope|Validate Scope]]*.[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-close-project|Close Project]]pe[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-control-quality|Control Quality]]Cl[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-deliverable|Deliverable]]ality|Control Quality]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-deliverable|Deliverable]]

### Accuracy 
**Definition.** Accuracy means the measured value is close to the true value.  
Precision means repeated measurements are consistent with each other.  
In project quality, accuracy is about hitting the target,  
while precision is about consistency of results, even if they’re off-target.

> **Exam cue.** If a deliverable is accurate but not precise,  
it hits the mark but inconsistently. If it's precise but not accurate,  
it consistently misses. The exam may ask you to prioritize one.  
Usually, **accuracy** wins in stakeholder satisfaction or acceptance criteri[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-control-quality|Control Quality]]

### Acquire Resources 
**Definition.** Acquire Resources is the process of obtaining  
the people, materials, equipment, and facilities required  
to execute project work. It typically occurs during executing,  
after planning identifies what's needed.

> **Exam cue.** Don’t confuse this with **Develop Team** (building capability)  
or **Manage Team** (day-to-day supervision).  
If a question involves securing or assigning resources,  
the answer is usually **Acquire Resources**.  
This may also involve negotiat[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-resource-management|Resource management]]te[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-project-management-plan|Project Management Plan]] [[[04-glossary - Copy#gloss-organizational-structures|Organizational structures]]0-glossary#gloss-organizational-structures|Organizational structures]]

### Activity 
[[#Glossary|Top]]
**Definition.** An activity is a discrete unit of scheduled work  
that consumes time and resources and contributes to a deliverable.  
Activities are derived from the WBS and form the building blocks of the schedule.

> **Exam cue.** Activities are created during **Define Activities**,  
sequenced in **Sequence Activities**, and estimated in **Estimate Activity Durations**.  
Each activity is connected to predecessors [[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-define-activities|Define Activities]]Re[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-sequence-activities|Sequence Activities]]it[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-wbs|WBS]]quence-activities|Sequence Activities]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-wbs|WBS]]

[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Activity Attributes  
**Definition.** Activity attributes are metadata about a scheduled activity—  
including IDs, leads/lags, resource needs, calendar constraints, and dependencies.  
They provide detail beyond the activity list itself.

> **Exam cue.** If a question asks “Where is this info stored?”  
about resource calendars, lead/lag time, or dependencies,  
answer: **Activity Attributes**.  
It’s an output of **Define Activities** and su[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-activity|Activity]]ur[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-sequence-activities|Sequence Activities]]iv[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-schedule|Schedule]]ivities|Sequence Activities]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-schedule|Schedule]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Activity Duration Estimate  
**Definition.** An activity duration estimate is a prediction  
of how long a scheduled activity will take to complete,  
based on known resources, methods, and conditions.  
It’s typically expressed as a range or a single-point value.

> **Exam cue.** PMI emphasizes **three-point estimating** (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic)  
and methods like **PERT**, **analogous**, **parametric**, and **bottom-up**.  
Choose based on data availability and detail level. [[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-estimate-activity-durations|Estimate Activity Durations]]os[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-pert|PERT]]ra[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-estimating-techniques|Estimating techniques]]T]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-estimating-techniques|Estimating techniques]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Activity List  
**Definition.** The activity list is a complete catalog  
of all scheduled project activities, each with a unique ID and description.  
It is created as an output of **Define Activities**.

> **Exam cue.** The activity list feeds sequencing and estimating processes.  
It’s not just a to-do list—it's a **core input** for building  
the schedule model and network diagram.  
Expect exam ques[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-activity|Activity]]me[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-schedule-baseline|Schedule baseline]]|A[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-sequence-activities|Sequence Activities]]eline]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-sequence-activities|Sequence Activities]]

### Activity Network Diagram
#### AoN/PDM  
**Definition.** An activity network diagram visually displays  
activities and their logical relationships (dependencies)  
using nodes (boxes) and arrows—commonly in the **Precedence Diagramming Method**.

> **Exam cue.** Know the four relationship types:  
Finish-to-Start (FS), Finish-to-Finish (FF), Start-to-Start (SS), Start-to-Finish (SF).  
This diagram supports **critical path analysis**  
and helps identify schedule[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-critical-path|Critical path]]ng[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-sequence-activities|Sequence Activities]] p[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-schedule-compression|Schedule compression]]ies]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-schedule-compression|Schedule compression]]

### Adaptive Life Cycle  
**Definition.** An adaptive life cycle delivers work  
in short, iterative increments that allow for frequent inspection and adaptation.  
It embraces change and prioritizes value delivery and customer feedback.

> **Exam cue.** Adaptive = Agile.  
Scope is flexible. Time and cost are often fixed.  
If you see uncertainty, fast feedback, evolving requirements,  
or value-first language—choose an **adaptive** approach.  
Avoid upfron[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-hybrid|Hybrid (life cycle)]]as[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-mvp|MVP]]sa[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-iteration|Iteration]]90-glossary#gloss-mvp|MVP]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-iteration|Iteration]]

[[#Glossary|Top]] 
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Adaptive Planning  
**Definition.** Adaptive planning is the practice of creating plans  
just-in-time for near-term work while leaving future work loosely defined.  
It reflects progressive elaboration in agile and hybrid approaches.

> **Exam cue.** PMI contrasts adaptive planning with full upfront predictive planning.  
Use it in changing environments.  
Tied closely to **rolling-wave planning**, **backlog refinement**, and **incremental delivery**.  
Don’t [[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-rolling-wave|Rolling-wave planning]]*R[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-progressive-elaboration|Progressive elaboration]] [[[04-glossary - Copy#gloss-backlog|Backlog]]ation|Progressive elaboration]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-backlog|Backlog]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Adjourning  
**Definition.** The **final stage** of team development—  
when the project ends or the team disbands.  
Focus shifts to closure, recognition, and emotional transition.

> **Exam cue.** If the question describes team members leaving, handing off, or winding down—this is your stage.[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-tuckman-stages|Tuckman stages]]io[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-close-project|Close Project or Phase]]n [[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-lessons-learned|Lessons learned]]ject or Phase]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-lessons-learned|Lessons learned]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Agile  
**Definition.** Agile is a **way of working that values flexibility, fast feedback, and frequent delivery**.  
It’s not a process—it’s a mindset. Agile teams learn by doing, adjust as they go,  
and focus on giving the customer something useful sooner rather than perfect later.

> **Exam cue.** If the question talks about responding to change, working closely with stakeholders,  
or delivering value in short bursts—it’s pointing at Agile.  
You’ll see it in planning, scope, risk, and even stakeholder engagement.  
Agile means you don’t need to kno[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-agile-manifesto|Agile Manifesto]]d.[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-hybrid|Hybrid life cycle]]es[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-incremental-delivery|Incremental delivery]]cle]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-incremental-delivery|Incremental delivery]]

### Agile Center of Excellence
#### ACoE

**Definition.** An Agile Center of Excellence is a group within the organization  
that supports consistent and effective use of Agile practices  
by providing coaching, tools, and shared knowledge.

> **Exam cue.** ACoEs are treated as **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)**  
that support consistency across teams and help scale Agile.  
On the exam, they oft[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-organizational-process-assets|Organizational Process Assets]]ry[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-hybrid|Hybrid (life cycle)]]na[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-agile|Agile mindset]]ybrid|Hybrid (life cycle)]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-agile|Agile mindset]]

### Agile Ceremonies  
**Definition.** Agile ceremonies are structured events  
used to synchronize, inspect, and adapt work.  
Examples include sprint planning, daily standups, reviews, and retrospectives.

> **Exam cue.** Know the purpose of each ceremony:  
**Planning** (what to do), **daily** (coordination), **review** (demo), **retro** (improve).  
Avoid cargo-cult Agile: ceremon[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-scrum-ceremonies|Scrum ceremonies]]**[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-agile|Agile]]sc[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-iteration|Iteration]]lossary#gloss-agile|Agile]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-iteration|Iteration]]

[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Agile Mindset  
**Definition.** Agile is a mindset grounded in value delivery,  
collaboration, rapid feedback, and adaptive planning.  
It emphasizes individuals, working solutions, and responding to change.

> **Exam cue.** If a scenario is about change, feedback, value, or collaboration—  
Agile mindset fits. Don’t mistake Agile for just ceremonies (e.g., daily standups).[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-adaptive-life-cycle|Adaptive (life cycle)]]d:[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-agile-ceremonies|Agile ceremonies]]li[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-scrum-ceremonies|Scrum ceremonies]] ceremonies]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-scrum-ceremonies|Scrum ceremonies]]

### Backlog  
**Definition.** A backlog is an ordered list of work items  
that represent future value to be delivered by the project or team.  
Backlogs are dynamic, evolving artifacts used in adaptive environments,  
often prioritized by customer value, risk, and learning.

> **Exam cue.** Backlogs are used in adaptive/hybrid life cycles.  
They are not frozen scope documents—they flex as feedback is received.  
Don’t treat the backlog like a predictive WBS or scope baseline.  
Near-term items ar[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-adaptive-life-cycle|Adaptive (life cycle)]]d:[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-iteration|Iteration]]cl[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-scope-baseline|Scope baseline]]ation|Iteration]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-scope-baseline|Scope baseline]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Backlog Refinement  
**Definition.** Backlog refinement is the ongoing process  
of reviewing, updating, and reordering backlog items  
to ensure near-term work is actionable, clear, and appropriately prioritized.

> **Exam cue.** Refinement reduces churn and uncertainty.  
It’s tied to progressive elaboration and just-in-time planning.  
Items that are too large or vague should be split or clarified.  
Expect exam cues aroun[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-backlog|Backlog]]an[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-progressive-elaboration|Progressive elaboration]] [[[04-glossary - Copy#gloss-iteration-planning|Iteration planning]]oration]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-iteration-planning|Iteration planning]]

### Balanced Scorecard  
**Definition.** A balanced scorecard is a performance framework  
that tracks metrics across multiple perspectives—financial, customer,  
internal processes, and learning/growth—aligned to strategic goals.

> **Exam cue.** Use when exam questions ask for more than cost/schedule KPIs.  
The balanced scorecard offers a holistic view.  
Especially useful [[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-governance|Governance]]mp[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-kpi|KPI]]-g[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-business-value|Business value]]y#gloss-kpi|KPI]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-business-value|Business value]]

---
### Baseline  
**Definition.** A baseline is the approved version of a plan  
used as a reference for comparison during project execution.  
Common baselines include scope, schedule, and cost.

> **Exam cue.** You need formal change control to modify a baseline.  
Avoid “informal” updates—these invalidate performance tracking.  
Variance i[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-change-request|Change request]]t.[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-scope-baseline|Scope baseline]]|C[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-schedule-baseline|Schedule baseline]] b[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-cost-baseline|Cost baseline]]Schedule baseline]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-cost-baseline|Cost baseline]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Basis of Estimates
#### BoE  
**Definition.** The basis of estimates documents how cost or duration estimates  
were developed—including assumptions, constraints, and data sources.

> **Exam cue.** Use BoE to support transparency, review, and risk analysis.  
If a question involves validating or justifying an estimate—BoE is your answer.  
Also h[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-bottom-up-estimating|Bottom-up estimating]]d:[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-contingency|Contingency]]|B[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-estimating-techniques|Estimating techniques]]y]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-estimating-techniques|Estimating techniques]]

### Benefit Cost Ratio
#### BCR
**Definition.** Benefit–cost ratio compares the expected benefits of a project  
to its expected costs. A BCR greater than 1 indicates a profitable investment.

> **Exam cue.** Financial decision tools often include BCR, NPV, IRR.  
Choose BCR when the question is about simple economic justification.  
Be ca[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-business-case|Business case]]en[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-npv|Net Present Value (NPV)]]as[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-roi|ROI]]ary#gloss-npv|Net Present Value (NPV)]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-roi|ROI]]

---
### Benefits Management Plan  
**Definition.** The benefits management plan describes  
how and when the project's intended benefits will be realized and sustained.

> **Exam cue.** It supports **business value delivery**, not just project closure.  
Ownership of benefits may extend beyond the project life cycle.  
Ti[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-benefits-realization|Benefits realization management]]-g[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-business-value|Business value]]ti[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-close-project|Close Project]]ue|Business value]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-close-project|Close Project]]

[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Benefits Owner  
**Definition.** The benefits owner is the person or role **accountable for realizing a specific benefit**  
defined in the business case or benefits management plan.  
They may come from the business unit, not the project team.

> **Exam cue.** Use this when PMI asks “Who ensures we actually get the value we planned for?”  
This is post-project accountability—not delivery, but realization.  
It appea[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-benefits-realization|Benefits realization management]]-g[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-business-case|Business case]]za[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-owner|Owner]]gloss-business-case|Business case]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-owner|Owner]]

---
### Benefits Realization Management  
**Definition.** Benefits realization management is the process  
of ensuring project outcomes deliver the intended benefits over time.

> **Exam cue.** Look for lifecycle language:  
**Plan → Deliver → Transition → Sustain.**  
Responsibilities may extend past the PM.

### Beta Distribution  
**Definition.** The beta distribution is a **probability model**  
used in project estimation when the most likely outcome is weighted more heavily than the extremes.  
It reflects uncertainty while avoiding overly simplistic averages.

> **Exam cue.** Use this when the exam presents a three-point estimate using:  
(O + 4M + P) ÷ 6 — that’s a **beta-weighted** formula.  
Compared to triangular (simple[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-pert|PERT]]re[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-three-point-estimate|Three-point estimate]]ER[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-estimate-activity-durations|Estimate Activity Durations]]ossary#gloss-estimate-activity-durations|Estimate Activity Durations]]
### Bid  
**Definition.** A bid is a seller’s **formal offer of price**  
for delivering goods or services under defined terms.  
It’s usually submitted in response to an RFQ (Request for Quotation) or RFP.

> **Exam cue.** Use “bid” when the question emphasizes **cost, competition**, or price-based vendor selection.  
This is common in **fixed-pric[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-proposal|Proposal]]es[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-source-selection-criteria|Source selection criteria]]0-[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-contract-types|Contract types]]ection criteria]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-contract-types|Contract types]]

(Objectives and Key Results)  
**Definition.** OKRs link a high-level objective with 3–5 measurable key results that indicate success. The objective describes what you're trying to achieve; the key results describe how you’ll know you’re making progress. OKRs are often used to align teams with organizational goals and to foster accountability and transparency in results-driven environments.

> **Exam cue.** If the exam scenario involves aligning project efforts with organizational strategy or tracking value-based outcomes, OKRs are the right match. Don’t confuse them with simple KPIs—OKRs emphasize **progress toward transformation**, not just completion. A strong OKR has a bold qualitative statement and several quantitative key results. Watch for them in Ag[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-benefits-management-plan|Benefits management plan]][9[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-objective-smart|Objective (SMART)]]ge[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-key-success-criteria|Key success criteria]]RT)]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-key-success-criteria|Key success criteria]]

### Opportunity
(risk)  
**Definition.** An opportunity is a **positive risk**—an uncertain event that, if it occurs, could benefit the project. It might improve schedule, reduce cost, or enhance quality. Opportunity responses include **exploit**, **enhance**, and **share**.

> **Exam cue.** The exam often tests your ability to spot **positive risks** and choose the right response. If something good *might* happen (but isn’t guaranteed), it’s an opportunity. Don’t treat it like a threat—your response should aim to **capitalize**, not avoid. If the upside is guaranteed and highly valuable, you may choose to **exploit** it; if[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-risk-management-plan|Risk management plan]]te[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-risk-response-strategies|Risk response strategies]][9[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-exploit|Exploit (opportunity)]]on[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-enhance|Enhance (opportunity)]]t (opportunity)]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-enhance|Enhance (opportunity)]]

### Opportunity cost  
**Definition.** Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative  
not selected when a decision is made. It represents the benefit you give up  
by choosing one path over another—especially relevant in cost-benefit and project selection analysis.

> **Exam cue.** If a question asks about comparing options, especially in business case analysis, watch for **opportunity cost**. PMI treats this as a **strategic concept**, not a line-item cost. It reflects what was lost by not pursuing the second-best option[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-cost-benefit-analysis|Cost-benefit analysis]]d:[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-payback-period|Payback period]]en[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-business-case|Business case]]od|Payback period]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-business-case|Business case]]

### Organizational Breakdown Structure
(OBS)  
**Definition.** The OBS maps the project’s work to the performing organization’s hierarchy.  
It shows which departments or units are responsible for specific WBS elements  
and helps connect accountability to deliverables.

> **Exam cue.** If the question references aligning work with departments,  
reporting structure, or assigning accountability across teams,  
this is the right tool. Don’t confuse the OBS with the WBS—  
the WBS breaks down work, the OBS assigns it.  
Often used in **resource planning**, [[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-wbs|Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)]]

### Organizational Governance  
**Definition.** Organizational governance refers to the system of rules,  
policies, processes, and decision-making structures that guide how projects align  
with organizational strategy, comply with standards, and maintain accountability.

> **Exam cue.** If a scenario mentions audits, escalation routes,  
oversight boards, or decision thresholds—this is your term.  
Governance controls whether the project stays aligned to enterprise goals.  
Don’t confuse this with project governance (day-to-day co[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-governance|Governance]]g [[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-pmo|Project Management Office (PMO)]]ov[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-organizational-structure|Organizational structure]][90-glossary#gloss-organizational-structure|Organizational structure]]

### Organizational Process Assets
(OPAs)  
**Definition.** OPAs are internal assets like templates, procedures,  
historical information, and knowledge bases used to plan and execute the project.  
They’re unique to each organization and available to the project team.

> **Exam cue.** When asked “what input helps define how to do the work?”—  
this is the answer.  
Unlike EEFs, OPAs are **within your control** and should be tailored and reused.  
They are inputs[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-eefs|Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)]]:*[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-lessons-learned-register|Lessons learned register]][9[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-knowledge-repository|Knowledge repository]]ter]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-knowledge-repository|Knowledge repository]]

### Organizational Structure 
**Definition.** Organizational structure defines how roles, responsibilities,  
and reporting lines are arranged. PMI highlights **functional**, **matrix** (weak/balanced/strong),  
and **projectized** as key types, each affecting the PM’s authority and resource control.

> **Exam cue.** If the question is about reporting, decision authority,  
or how resources are assigned, this is the term.  
Expect matrix to be the most tested.  
Remember: Functional =[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-functional-organization|Functional organization]] [[[04-glossary - Copy#gloss-projectized-organization|Projectized organization]][9[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-matrix-organization|Matrix organization]]ation]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-matrix-organization|Matrix organization]]

### Output  
**Definition.** An output is any tangible or intangible result  
produced by a process. It could be a document, decision, deliverable, update, or plan.  
Outputs are tracked, baselined, and used to control progress.

> **Exam cue.** Watch for questions about **process results**.  
If it asks “What comes out of this process?”—you’re looking for an output.  
Be ready to distinguish between outputs (created during the process)  
and deliverables (what the[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-deliverable|Deliverable]]li[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-performance-reports|Performance reports]]ra[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-project-management-plan|Project Management Plan]] [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-project-management-plan|Project Management Plan]]

### Over Allocation  
**Definition.** Over-allocation occurs when a resource is assigned  to more tasks than they can complete in the available time.  It results in schedule slippage, burnout risk, and quality issues if not addressed.

> **Exam cue.** When the exam presents a resource scheduled on multiple tasks at once,  
or a delay caused by resource unavailability—this is your red flag.  
PMI expects the PM to resolve this by applying **resource leveling**,  
negotiating trade-offs, or adjusting the schedule.  
It often shows up in **resou[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-resource-optimization|Resource optimization]]d:[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-resource-leveling|Resource leveling]]im[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-schedule-variance|Schedule variance]] leveling]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-schedule-variance|Schedule variance]]

---
### Overlapping Phases  
**Definition.** Overlapping phases occur when **a subsequent phase begins before the prior one is fully complete**. This is a form of **fast tracking**—a schedule compression technique used to shorten timelines by performing activities in parallel rather than in sequence.

> **Exam cue.** Use this when the exam talks about “starting work early” or “reducing schedule length.”  
Overlapping phases = faster deliv[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-fast-tracking|Fast tracking]]at[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-schedule-compression|Schedule compression]]in[[glossary-files/90-glossary#gloss-sequential-phases|Sequential phases]]mpression]], [[00-pmp-pmo/hub/90-glossary#gloss-sequential-phases|Sequential phases]]
