## What this page is about  

This page explains PMI’s 12 **Project Management Principles** — a foundational component of the [PMP exam](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp) and the [[jasytionline.github.io/2-references|PMBOK® Guide – Seventh Edition.]] These principles provide the mindset and ethical compass for how projects should be led, regardless of delivery method ([[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#predictive|Predictive]], [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#agile|Agile]], or [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#hybrid|Hybrid]]).  

You’ll learn what each principle means, how it appears in real projects, and how to recognize principle-driven thinking on the exam. This content is aligned with [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/01-test-prep/04-eco|PMI’s Exam Content Outline (ECO)]] and [PMBOK guidance.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge)

## What are the Principles of Project Management  
PMI defines 12 key principles to guide project performance and behavior. These are not rigid rules, but universally applicable values that empower decision-making across [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/100-published/110-modules/03-lifecycle/index|project lifecycles]] and industries.  

Each principle reflects a mindset. Together, they shape how project professionals lead, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#collaboration|collaborate]], and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#value delivery|deliver value]].

---
[[#Project Management Principles|Top]]  
### 1. Be a Diligent, Respectful, and Caring Steward  
Demonstrate responsibility for [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#resource|resources]], outcomes, and [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/01-test-prep/04-eco#Domain I: People (42% of the exam)||people.]] Care for the long-term impact of your project on the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#organization|organization]], [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#business environment|environment]], and community. [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stewardship|Stewardship]] goes beyond ownership; it reflects integrity and sustainability.  

 *Exam Tip*: This principle often aligns with questions involving [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#accountability|accountability]], ethical dilemmas, and sustainability trade-offs.

---
### 2. Create a Collaborative Project Team Environment  
Foster a culture where people feel safe to share, contribute, and challenge. Teams thrive when there is [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#psychological safety|psychological safety]], mutual respect, and shared decision-making.  

[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#collaboration|Collaboration]] and psychological safety are key cues in scenario-based questions here.

---

### 3. Effectively Engage with Stakeholders  
Proactively identify and involve [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#stakeholder|stakeholders]] throughout the project. Build trust, manage expectations, and ensure inclusive participation to co-create value.  

Look for clues about stakeholder communication, feedback loops, and relationship building.

---

### 4. Focus on Value  
Deliver tangible and intangible [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#value|value]] aligned with business goals. Prioritize efforts that maximize outcomes over outputs. Continually reassess to ensure relevance and benefit.  

On the exam, value-driven reasoning often beats cost- or schedule-only logic.

---
[[#Project Management Principles|Top]]  
### 5. Recognize, Evaluate, and Respond to System Interactions  
Use [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#systems thinking|systems thinking]] to understand the ripple effects of decisions across the project ecosystem. Projects do not exist in isolation — consider enterprise, cultural, and environmental dimensions.  

Keywords include interdependencies, EEFs, and unintended consequences.

---

### 6. Demonstrate Leadership Behaviors  
Model leadership through integrity, vision, and empathy — not just authority. Leadership includes guiding teams, resolving conflicts, and removing impediments.  

PMI prefers servant, situational, and transformational [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#leadership|leadership]] styles over autocratic ones.

---

### 7. Tailor Based on Context  
Apply [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#tailoring|tailoring]] to select the right methods, tools, and approaches based on the unique needs of each project. There's no one-size-fits-all methodology.  

Avoid applying "best practices" blindly — PMI wants contextual thinking.

---

### 8. Build Quality into Processes and Deliverables  
Embed [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#quality|quality]] into every step. Prevent defects, don’t just detect them. Involve the team in continual improvement and validation of work.  

Questions may reference quality assurance vs. control, or process audits.

---
[[#Project Management Principles|Top]]  
### 9. Navigate Complexity  
Acknowledge and actively manage [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#complexity|complexity]] — whether from scope, stakeholders, technologies, or external influences. Seek simplicity where possible, but plan for ambiguity.  

On the exam, don't oversimplify nuanced situations; consider adaptability.

---

### 10. Optimize Risk Responses  
Address both threats and opportunities with proactive [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#risk management|risk management]]. Use appropriate strategies (avoid, mitigate, enhance, exploit) and involve the team in identification and planning.  

Many situational questions involve selecting the most appropriate risk response.

---

### 11. Embrace Adaptability and Resilience  
Support change, learning, and fast feedback. Encourage continuous improvement and embrace failure as a path to growth.  

PMI aligns this with Agile mindsets — expect scenarios involving changing requirements or uncertainty.

---

### 12. Enable Change to Achieve the Envisioned Future State  
Lead transformation by promoting [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#change management|change management]] and helping stakeholders transition effectively. Projects are agents of change — your role includes enabling adoption.  

Look for phrases like resistance, readiness, and stakeholder buy-in.

## Applying Project Management Principles in Practice  

The principles come alive in day-to-day project actions — whether you're leading a predictive IT deployment or a hybrid product launch. Below are real-world illustrations across delivery approaches:

### Predictive (Waterfall) Example  
- You ensure formal [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#acceptance|acceptance]] of deliverables (Principle 1 – Stewardship).  
- You use a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#RACI|RACI matrix]] to clarify roles, ensuring team collaboration (Principle 2).  
- You escalate a critical issue using defined governance channels (Principle 6 – Leadership).  

### Agile Example  
- You empower the team during [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#sprint|sprint]] retrospectives (Principles 2, 11).  
- You adjust priorities based on stakeholder input in the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#product backlog|product backlog]] (Principle 3 – Stakeholder Engagement).  
- You visualize workflow with a Kanban board and use [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#burndown chart|burndown chart]]s for transparency (Principles 8, 12).  

### Hybrid Example  
- You tailor your planning: predictive for regulatory work, agile for user testing (Principle 7).  
- You focus on incremental [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#value delivery|value delivery]] through both documented plans and iterative cycles (Principle 4).  
- You manage [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#risk management|risk]] by combining qualitative matrices with sprint-based feedback (Principle 10).

## Principle-Driven Reasoning  

On the PMP exam, understanding the principles helps you **choose the "most right" answer** — not just a technically correct one. Here's how principle-driven logic is tested:

- Two answers may be correct, but the one that respects stewardship, value, or stakeholder engagement more will be preferred.  
- You will often need to resolve **conflicting priorities** — such as schedule pressure versus quality. Principles guide which trade-offs align with PMI's philosophy.  
- The test rewards answers that reflect **long-term thinking**, team empowerment, and ethical responsibility.  

### Decision Flow Example  
A team member reports a defect that will delay delivery. What should the project manager do?

- A: Deliver anyway to meet schedule.  
- B: Escalate to sponsor for waiver.  
- C: Evaluate impact and collaborate with the team to determine options.  
- D: Replace the team member.

✅ The best choice is C. It reflects **Principles 2 (Collaboration), 6 (Leadership), 8 (Quality), and 11 (Resilience)**.  

The exam logic favors **principles over quick wins**.

## Applying Project Management Principles on Exam Day  

Here’s how to *think like PMI* under pressure:

- **Pause** before choosing an answer. Ask yourself: “Which option best reflects PMI's principles?”  
- **Remove ego** and "real-world shortcuts." PMI tests what should be done in a professional, value-driven environment.  
- **Scan for principle alignment** — collaboration, stewardship, quality, value. These are hidden exam clues.  
- **Watch out for red flags**: blame, shortcuts, command-and-control styles, ignoring stakeholders — PMI rarely rewards these.  
- Use the principles to navigate ambiguity. PMI questions are not always black and white — your mindset is the compass.

Try answering practice questions using the principle lens. You'll often find the "most right" answer by identifying which principle is being honored.
