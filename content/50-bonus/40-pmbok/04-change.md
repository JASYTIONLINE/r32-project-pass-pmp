## Change is Inevitable

Every [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project-plan|project plan]] seems stable until it meets the real world. And in the real world, things move. [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#requirements|Requirements]] evolve, priorities shift, technologies emerge, [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/02-pmbok/02-risk|risks]] materialize, and [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/02-pmbok/01-stakeholder|stakeholders]] change their minds. In [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project-management|project management]], 
The presence of change is not a sign of poor planning. In fact, the ability to respond to change deliberately is one of the defining traits of a well-managed project. A change-aware [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project-manager|project manager]] doesn’t resist the unexpected. They expect it — and prepare to manage it in a way that aligns with both delivery and value.

When preparing for the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#pmp|PMP exam]], it’s critical to understand that [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#pmi|PMI]] does not treat change as negative by default. What matters is how it is identified, assessed, and integrated into the [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/100-published/110-modules/03-lifecycle/index|project system]]. Projects that embrace structured change are more likely to stay relevant and deliver value (see *PMBOK 6* and *PMBOK 7* in [[jasytionline.github.io/2-references|References]]).

## What This Page Is About

This page explores what change really means in the context of [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/100-published/110-modules/02-pmbok/index|PMI’s project management framework]]. It offers a grounded understanding of:

- What “change” refers to in a project  
- How it impacts project elements like [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#scope|scope]], [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#schedule|schedule]], and [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#cost|cost]]  
- Why managing change is a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#leadership|leadership]] function, not just a control mechanism  
- What PMI expects project managers to do with [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#change-requests|change requests]] and emerging issues  
- How change can be both a source of opportunity and a source of risk  

By the end, you’ll have a foundation solid enough to recognize how much you don’t yet know — and exactly where to look next (including *The Discipline of Organizing* in [[jasytionline.github.io/2-references|References]]).

## What Is Change?

Change in PMI’s terms refers to any intentional or unintentional modification to the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#baseline|baseline]] of a project — including scope, schedule, budget, quality, [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#resources|resources]], or [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#risk|risk]] posture. It can originate from nearly any direction: it can come from  [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/30-pmp/300-pmp-modules/02-pmbok/03-eef-opa|EEFs or/and OPAs;]] a stakeholder may adjust expectations, a compliance regulation may shift midstream, or project work might reveal flawed assumptions or hidden dependencies.

The key is that change always alters the agreed-upon plan in some way. It introduces [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#uncertainty|uncertainty]] and often requires re-evaluation of decisions previously considered “locked.” PMI expects [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project manager|project managers]] not to fear change, but to anticipate it and manage it using an integrated, principled approach.

You don’t need to memorize a definition to succeed on the exam — you need to recognize when a situation represents a change, and what disciplined steps follow. Understanding the difference between evolving project needs and unmanaged [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#scope-creep|scope creep]] begins here.

## Why Change Is Often a Good Thing

Handled correctly, change is not a threat — it’s a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#value|value signal.]] It’s a way of keeping the project aligned with real-world needs, not just sticking rigidly to an outdated plan. A stakeholder refining their requirements may improve final usability. A market-driven scope shift may create new revenue opportunities. A discovered technical capability may shorten delivery timelines.

Good change happens when the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project environment|environment]] shifts and the project **responds** instead of resists. It protects relevance. It reflects agility. And it often increases stakeholder satisfaction — not by adding work, but by *delivering more of what matters.*

PMI favors this mindset: a change that increases value is worth exploring. But it must still pass through a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#change management|process]] — not just be accepted informally.

---

## Why Change Can Be Harmful

Despite its benefits, change becomes harmful when it’s not managed with care. Uncontrolled change leads directly to the most common project problems: [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#schedule slippage|Schedule Slippage]], cost overruns, loss of scope clarity, and stakeholder confusion.

This happens when changes are implemented without [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#analysis|analysis]], approval, or [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#communication|communication]]. When one stakeholder pushes through a requirement midstream without consulting the team. When a developer makes updates before understanding the impact. Or when the change process is bypassed entirely in a rush to satisfy short-term demands.

PMI flags these behaviors on the exam as indicators of misalignment and poor [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#governance|governance]]. You won’t be asked whether change is good or bad — but you will be tested on whether it was **handled correctly**.

---

## How PMI Defines Change Management

Change management is not a single document or role. It’s a set of structured activities that ensure all proposed changes are captured, assessed, approved, and implemented in a way that protects the project’s integrity.

A change doesn’t become “managed” just because it’s discussed. PMI expects you to follow a disciplined process, typically along these lines:

1. **Identification and logging** — the change is recognized and formally recorded using a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#change-requests|change request]] and entered in the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#change-log|change log]].  
2. **Impact analysis** — the potential effects on cost, time, scope, quality, risk, and resources are examined.  
3. **Review and decision** — the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#change-control-board|Change Control Board]] (or authorized entity) evaluates and either approves, rejects, or defers the change.  
4. **Implementation** — no change is applied until it is formally approved, and adjustments are reflected in the updated baselines.  

On the exam, questions that skip this order — or implement before approval — are nearly always distractors. PMI prioritizes *transparency, traceability, and accountability* over speed or convenience.

## The Role of Governance and Configuration

To understand change fully, it helps to see it within the broader landscape of [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#project-governance|project governance]]. Change control is not isolated; it intersects with [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#configuration-management|configuration management]] — the system for ensuring that product versions, documents, and deliverables are consistently tracked and verified.

PMI separates **[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#change-control|change control]]** (deciding *if* something should change) from **[[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#configuration-control|configuration control]]** (tracking *what* has changed and ensuring it’s correct). Both exist to protect project consistency.

Changes that affect [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#deliverable|deliverables]] — like a design update or a version upgrade — must pass through both systems to ensure the final output matches the revised requirements.

## Where Change and Leadership Intersect

Change isn’t just about control — it’s about [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#communication|communication.]] High-performing project managers don’t wait for change to become a crisis. They create visibility around uncertainty, open conversations about impacts, and invite cross-functional input before decisions are made.

This includes surfacing hidden risks tied to changes, clarifying who will be affected, and protecting [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#scope|Project Scope]] from becoming bloated by well-intended requests. It also includes advocating for change when it’s the right move — even if it’s politically risky.

Change is not just a technical layer of process — it’s a leadership behavior.

## Questions Worth Asking

When you understand the foundations of change, you begin to uncover deeper lines of inquiry:

- How do I recognize when a suggestion is actually a [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#change-requests|change request]]?  
- What tools help me track changes across [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/100-published/110-modules/03-lifecycle/index|baselines]]?  
- When is stakeholder pushback a change in disguise?  
- How do configuration and change control reinforce each other?  
- What’s the cost of accepting change informally, even when it seems harmless?  
- How can [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary#agile|Agile]] teams manage change without formal CCBs?  

Let these questions drive further exploration — in the [[jasytionline.github.io/3-glossary|Glossary]], in your courseware, or in practice exam reviews. PMI won’t ask you to recite a definition — but it will expect you to *think like a project manager* when change shows up.
