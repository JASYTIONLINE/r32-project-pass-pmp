# Project PASS PMP  
### Learn it. See it. Live it. Speak it.

I know what your thinking! 
You’re not just trying to pass an exam—you’re learning to *think* like a project manager.  
This site is your interactive companion to the PMI® Authorized Exam Prep Course (Workbook v3.2).  
Every lesson, story, and tool is built to move with you—step-by-step, day-by-day—until PMP concepts feel second nature.
