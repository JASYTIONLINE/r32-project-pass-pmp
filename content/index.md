![image of pm team][pmp-team-heros.png]
*Learn it. See it. Live it. Speak it.*

I know what your thinking! You’re not just trying to pass an exam—you’re learning to *think* like a project manager.  This site is your interactive companion to the PMI® Authorized Exam Prep Course (Workbook v3.2). Every lesson, story, and tool is built to move with you—step-by-step, day-by-day—until PMP concepts feel second nature.

## Choose Your Path
### [01 - Structured Self Learning](10-structured/index.md)

#### PMP Modules – Structured Learning  
Follow the official workbook’s six-lesson sequence.  
Business Environment → Start the Project → Plan the Project → Lead the Team → Support Performance → Close the Project.  
Straightforward, practical, mapped exactly to the Exam Content Outline.  

### [02 - Case Study – The Project in Motion](20-case-study/10-artifacts/index.md)  
---

See how this web site was built using PMI Project Management Professional Practices. Walk through a single initiative from spark to delivery.  Create every part of the plan, then execute it.
Every phase mirrors the workbook’s lessons, so theory turns into practice in real time.  See how a project lives, breathes, and changes.  

### [03 Step Through The Lore Door – Learn Through Story](30-the-lore-door/index.md)
---

Step into an original narrative world where PMP principles drive the plot.  
Each chapter parallels the same lesson progression you’ll see in the workbook.  
It’s fiction—but the project management is real.  
### Lore Fidelity Guarantee
All content follows strict adherence to PMI Exam Content Outline Parameters
This means:
- No metaphors that break PMI accuracy  
- No invented processes or artifacts  
- All story elements map clearly to real project management practices

If you stripped out the metaphors, a PMI instructor should still nod and say: *"Yes, that’s how it works."*
