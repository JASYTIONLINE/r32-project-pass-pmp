#  Course Introduction — How This Works

## Welcome to JASYTI's Project Pass PMP

You're about to begin a unique learning experience.
**20-day learning journey** built around a single, immersive story — the The Last Gate: an epic Interactive Science Fiction Tale of excitement and intrigue centered on the world of Project Management. Every PMI concept, exam domain, and glossary term appears **in context**, through character, conflict, and consequence.

###  One Skill Set: 4 ways to Learn It

This course is structured like a limited series:  
- 20 study sessions  
- Each session is an “episode” in the same story  
- Every episode teaches real PMP concepts by dramatizing them

You have two ways to engage:

#### Lore Binge (Front to Back)
Start at the beginning and move straight through.  
It’s like watching a show for the first time — each day builds on the last.  
Perfect if you're new to project management or studying for the PMP exam for the first time.

#### Rerun Mode (Pick and Choose)
Already in review mode?  
Jump into any lesson on demand. Every episode is self-contained, glossary-linked, and grounded in the PMP exam blueprint.  
Great for targeted reinforcement.

###  A 20-Day Structured Learning Cadence

This course is built to be completed in **20 learning days**.  
Study on **any 4-day-per-week schedule** that fits your life. Most learners finish in about **5 calendar weeks**.

Each session includes:
- A narrative-driven lesson
- PMP glossary terms linked inline
- Direct mapping to the PMP ECO (Exam Content Outline)
- Optional links to formulas, templates, and cheat sheets

---

###  How This System Works

- **Single-mode delivery**: The story is the lesson.
- Whether our doing traditional study or just reading a realluy cool science fiction story, every minute you spend here will help you synthesise the information and make it your own.
- Throughout this site:
	- **Every PMI term** is linked to the master [[10-glossary]]
	- **Every concept** is anchored to one or more ECO tasks via:
  - [[jasityonline/100-workshops/r33-project-managment/contents/100-Modules/60-close-the-project/510-domain-1-people]]
  - [[jasityonline/100-workshops/r33-project-managment/contents/100-Modules/60-close-the-project/520-domain-2-process]]
  - [[jasityonline/100-workshops/r33-project-managment/contents/100-Modules/60-close-the-project/530-domain-3-business-environmetn]]

The system is designed to help you **understand and retain concepts — not just memorize facts.

### Lore Fidelity Guarantee

All content follows strict adherence to PMI Exam Content Outline Parameters
This means:
- No metaphors that break PMI accuracy  
- No invented processes or artifacts  
- All story elements map clearly to real project management practices

> f you stripped out the metaphors, a PMI instructor should still nod and say: *"Yes, that’s how it works."*

### Course Structure Overview

- 20 episodes = 20 lessons = 20 ECO-aligned study days
