====================================================
Team Charter

Objectives: This is what we aim to attain through this class and its
  results - 

  * Obtain our PMP
  * Get through this entire content
  * Obtain our certificate so we can apply for the exam
  * Establish a solid preparation plan.
  * Learn something that helps us continue to move forward in our careers


Ground Rules
  Values
  * Responsibility - take ownership for decisions we make, actions we take,
	and consequences as these outcomes.

  * Respect - Show a high regard for *OURSELVES* others, and what's entrusted
	to us.

  * Fairness - Make decisions and act impartially and objectively.
	I don't want my opinion to be right, I want to hear ALL opinions
	and work with you to find the best one.

  * Honesty - Understand the truth. Act and speak in a truthful manner.
	We find out what's right and we speak of it and do it.

	**** We leave no one behind. Everyone crosses the finish line together.

  * Communications: We take statements and comments in chat as opinions and
    perceptions, not facts or truths. Even facts, without analysis, are not truth.

    We use debate to negotiate and come to agreement.

    Opinions and perceptions may be wrong; PEOPLE are not wrong.

    We embrace the truth. Being right doesn't get us closer to the truth; being
    wrong Does get us closer to the truth.

    "Greater clarification and transparency, less confusion."
	(Precision in our definitions)

  * Responsibility - we own our personal growth. This class requires not only
    acquisition of knowledge, but changes in perception and habit. 

    This includes a sense that we will be confused and frustrated. We accept 
    that this is just part of the process, and evidence we are doing this right.
	"All Growth is on the other side of Resistance" - Ryan Holiday
	'If you're frustrated, you're on the right path' - Tim

    60% of your learning will be received through observing how Tim leads, manages,
	and organizes the class. This class is intended to not be a lecture, but an
	immersive experience. 

Relax, take a breath, and think a little slower, and
	you'll see the patterns emerge.

How to Apply

When should I start the application? Now.
	You'll take about 2 weeks to fill it out,
	and then when you receive your Simplilearn certificate,
	you can send the application in.

Applying for the exam:
	What is 'experience in project management'
	- how do I document
	- what does this experience consist of?
	- did I 'do' projects?

What does the application process look like?

	Documenting the application
	- personal information
	- professional information
	- education
	- PM experience

	What is experience?

PMI requires that qualified PMP candidates:

* Perform their duties under general supervision and are responsible 
  for all aspects of the project for the life of the project
* Lead and direct cross-functional teams to deliver projects within 
  the constraints of schedule, budget and resources
* Demonstrate sufficient knowledge and experience to appropriately 
  apply a methodology to projects that have reasonably well-defined 
  project requirements and deliverables.

Project descriptions should consist of the following:

* A brief, one-sentence project objective
* Project deliverables summarized by process areas 
  (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing - 
   abbreviations are acceptable IN, PL, EX, MC & CL)

	Initiating		gaining project approval
	Planning		developing an appropriate plan
	executing		team performs work, PM leads team and
				manages work
	Monitoring &
	Controlling		data is collected, analyzed, changes
				performed
	Closing			deliverable transitioned, files archived.

* A brief, one-sentence project outcome

Project descriptions should be a high level summary of the tasks 
you led and directed on the project (e.g. Initiating: develop project 
charter etc.; Planning: Scope definition etc.; and so on). 

Project management experience is required in each of the process areas 
when all projects are totaled, but not on each project. 

Project descriptions must be provided for all projects submitted on 
application.

	Tim suggests:
	Document your open projects now (they count)
	and then document backwards in time until you have enough months.

How do I describe the work *I* Did?

	Use the exam content outline
	a) what work of mine was a project?
	b) what tasks did I perform?

	Don't know how to describe the work you did? Use the exam content outline
	tasks to start as a template.

		If you have a hard time describing the work you did,
		review the tasks in the Exam Content Outline and use that
		as a template.

	"I'm not a PM!!!"
	That's all right.
	PMI's not interested in your job title, or your assignment to the project.
	They're looking for the work you did, leading and managing the project.

	Each project will require a reference.
	That reference will only be needed under audit.

	3-5% of ALL OF US will be audited. It's random, almost never generated
	due to quality of application.

		Have ready (you don't have to send in at first)
		* university transcript (degree) - informal
		* Simplilearn certificate
		* references

	Reference: someone in higher authority, willing to speak for you if
	needed (validation of project experience)

		- manager, director, executive on project, even client.
		- NOT team member, another PM.

	Each project requires 1 reference, 1 reference can be such for
	> 1 project.

		Tim - I can't find my reference (the company closed)...
		Contact PMI - they've been solving this problem forever.

	Does PMO Head count as reference?
	Are they of higher rank? Yes.

	If my application is approved, so it means it did not need audit - 
	is my understanding correct ?
	Once PMI asks for money, you are accepted.

	IN order to apply, you need:

	If you still feel lack of confidence, download your completed application
	and contact support. They'll have you send it to an email, and it'll
	get to Learner success. Someone will review and recommend.

The exam doesn't test your ability to memorize.
It tests your ability to think, act, decide and behave.
	(The exam doesn't test your ability to use and memorize
		math formulas...????)

		This class is not an exercise in reading entire books.
		- IT's an exercise in learning how to think, act, decide
		  as a manager and leader.

	"What do you do now? What's the best option?
	 What is it you need to be thinking?"

	Sometimes all the options will be good.
	Sometimes all the options will be poor.

	I was trained by PMI to write these type of questions.
	I'll give you lots and lots of practice.

	The exam content outline documents the tasks you will be tested on.
	I've mapped the tasks to the topics we'll study

	Each task will show up about 4-5 times on every exam.

	you have 1.3 minutes to complete all questions.
	You'll be in a constant state of urgency through the exam.
	Don't worry. Just practice.

	Random exam:
	Your exam will be built when you sit down to test.
	It won't change; those will be your exam questions.
	
	multiple choice: 1 correct answer	(80-85%)

	2-correct answers (3) - more than 4 options

	If you're scoring 80-85% correct, you have enough knowledge to pass.
	You also have to pay attention:
		- focus
		- confidence
		- time management

	Take the exam remotely? In the test center?
	Pearson -Vue

	PMI Doesn't tell us the passing grade.
	They will evaluate the test immediately and say:

		- less than capable : business
		- capable: process
		- more than capable: leadership
			and you pass


	If you want to improve your score, improve during practice,
	not after exam.

	* Track the questions you got wrong
	* align them to the tasks in the exam content outline
	* look up the details in the training material
	* continue to practice.
	* if you don't observe changes in score every 3-4 days, 
	  you need to review your preparation method

	How to prepare (part of it).

Business Environment (sl. 01)

Foundation (sl. 03)

"Why are we jumping from the nature of project (adapt/Predect) to PMO definition
 /use????? What's the purpose?"

	These are the pieces of the picture of PM.
	We treat these as a set of pieces in a puzzle.

	In later material, we put these puzzle pieces together for greater purpose.
	Lesson 1	- we identify with the individual pieces.
	Further lessons - we learn to put them together.






This first section is like a picture puzzle.
	First thing
	* open box
	* dump pieces out
	* sort them
		white over here,
		blue over there,
		corners and sides back in the box

	That's what we're doing in lesson one.

WE know how much total time we have,
	but we don't know how much time each section
	will take

	I'll manage this class as an Agile project.

* Project
	Unique:	requires its own plan
	Creates a deliverable
		Product	a 'thing' or "noun"
		Service an 'action' or "verb"
		result  an "outcome"

			A project that results in a decision:
			"Shall we build a data center, and how
		 	 shall our data center be configured?"

	Specific start	- the project is approved
	Specific end    - the final deliverable is handed over

 	Provides a change
	Provides value

	Ex: Director: 'Go down to the factory floor; one of the tools needs
	some extra work. Whenever it's moved, a switch is turned, and it
	turns on. It could hurt someone; we need this fixed quickly.'

	Our 1st example project: "Build a box"

		1: deliverable a solution applied that fixes the problem
		2: Value:      'we can't have anyone get hurt'

* Evolution of PM
* PM Life Cycles and Development Approaches
  Project life cycle: the life a project goes through
	from its approval to when it transitions the final deliverable

	Development approach: "Method" <- 'a way we develop the project,
						"do the work"'

	Traditional
	Adaptive
	---------------
	Both life cycles
	and methods

	Traditional: Predictive - I can 'predict' the outcome to
					a high probability of success.
	* We've done this work before.
	  We can build and rely on a fairly accurate plan.
		'The plan leads to project success.'

	Adaptive: Adaptive: 'self-organizing'
	* We've NEVER done this work before.
	  We have to approach the work as a special type of group
	  and work through the unknown parts in a special way.
		'The relationships lead to project success.'

* Tim Adaptive project can be different phases of project which does result in different team taking over during those projects

	* adaptive can be operations work.
	  We will focus on applying adaptive inside projects,
	  but the mindset/tools are effective in day-to-day business.

	* There is a blend of adaptive and hybrid.
		Build a house for a family
		House frame, electricity, plumbing, data network
		* Predictive

		Choosing the paint, flooring while you go room-to-room
		* Adaptive


* Project Management Office (PMO)
	2 purposes
	* Standardize Project Management
	* Centralizes Project Management Information (knowledge base)

	3 levels of authority ('rank')
	- Supportive: 'gives advice'
	- Controlling: 'Makes decisions'	Healthcare, finance
		centralizes certain decision-making
	- Directive:   'Runs PM as a business'	consulting
						services
		ongoing authority, directives, and leadership

* Organizational Project Management
	PMO 	- a type of an organization
		  (standardizes, centralizes project management)

	OPM	- a framework any organization can adopt
		  (to take advantage and benefits of projects, project management)

* Projects, Programs, Portfolios

	Program:
		a group of projects, run in a certain way
		to obtain extra benefits not available
		by running them separately.

	I have 5 projects
	each project requires 2 trucks

	If I run them separately, I rent 10 trucks

	If I run these projects as a group, I
	may be able to rent fewer.

	trucks on projects might not be needed all the time, and I
	can move those trucks from project to project

		A group of projects individually run	10  trucks
		a group of projects as a program	6-7 trucks

		(that's the extra benefit)

	Program:	Program activities (program's administration)
			Extra benefits.

	Portfolio:	Operations (portfolio's administration)
			strategic (organizational, corporate) benefits

			
			Portfolio:	Launch this product into its market
			sub-portfolio:	Break the launch into different geographies

			Programs:	different technologies:
					marketing
					sales
					construction, instantiation of stores
					develo0pment of hte product

			Projects:	individual actions within the programs
					and portfolios

			"Project: Prepare and launch this service in Germany"

	Portfolio:
		a group of programs, sub-programs, projects,
		and OPERATIONS -
		Run in a certain way in order to gain strategic
		benefits.

	Programs are merely grouping projects
	Portfolios are RUNNING ALL THIS WORK AS A BUSINESS
		moving money around.
		moving resources around.
		Speeding work here, slowing work there.

		In order to meet the objectives of the organization.

	Operations: (supporting operations)
	- finance
	- legal
	- purchasing
	- human resources
	- ...

* Organizational Structures
	"If you understand the structure of an organization, you understand
		* why some organizations approach projects differently
		* why some PMs have high authority and why others have low authority"

* Relative Authority in Org Structures

	- Functional organization:
	' This organization provides a function (mainly a "support" function)
	to the rest of the corporation.

		projects are less important than the function
		(the pm may not have a lot of authority, or may
			even be just temporary)
	- finance
	- legal
	- purchasing
	- human resources

	- Project Oriented organizations use projects to generate
		revenue DIRECTLY, or succeed in a certain outcome directly. 
		Consulting, services.
	In a consulting group, the PM generates the money for everyone's
		salary. They demand almost total authority.

	Information Technology (IT)
	They look like a functional (support) organization
	They manage delivery as a series of projects

		MATRIX (combination: functional, project-oriented)
		Strong-matrix:	they are more focused on projects,
				than the support role they play.

We stop on sl. 13.

- What do I need to do for this class right now?
------------------------------------------------
* Start a journal, write down the topics that confuse you.

* Download, organize content you have access to. Review it
  for future reference.

* Start the self-learning content now. See if you can stay
  ahead of the slides we cover in class. Again, capture the
  topics and concepts you don't understand.

* We'll get into out-of-class assignments and practice
  questions soon enough; for now, get in a routine of 
  regularly attending and reviewing class.

====================================================
5:40 AM 9/21/2025

Scrum:	a framework "utilizing an agile mindset for developing, delivering, 
	and sustaining complex products." Includes servant leadership, self-
	organizing teams, reviews, retrospectives, and scrums, and other
	agile tools.

 Also:	A short, 15-minute meeting in which the complete team gets together 
	for a quick status update while standing in a circle.
		- What did we complete yesterday? (progress)
		- What are we working on today?	  (status)
		- What do we plan for tomorrow?   (forecast)
	 	* Issues, Risks

	We'll use a daily scrum (doesn't have to be daily) to introduce
	necessary information that doesn't show up in the slides, or you
	call for.

	Today:
	- What is the PMBOK? What are its details?
		PM Body of Knowledge:
			1981-6, 96, 2000. 2004, 2007, 2017...

	6e: 	the old PM Framework (how project management works)
		the old methodology (predictive)
		over 800 pgs.

		The PM Framework started as a group of good practice
		supported by academic reference (white papers, dissertations)
	-	- on this framework, we continued to build.

	7e:	new PM framework (over and outside methods)
		PMBOK (Sec.1)

		PRINCIPLES - concepts we embrace that shape our
		actions.

		Guide to PMBOK (Sec. 2)
		Domains: areas of PM where we apply our principles.

	Agile	New Agile methodology
	Practice
	Guide

	Process	New Predictive Methodology
	Group
	Practice
	Guide

	- What other PMI published documents have value for this class?
	- How do I use these to prepare?
	- Can I get them for free?

*****

From:	Lesson 1, sl.  13 PM Principles
To:	Lesson 1, sl.  67 Project Compliance

* PM Principles
	(P. 99, 7e PMBOK)

	Principles:	ideas, notions and opinions that drive
			our behavior.

* PM Domains
	Domains: Areas of focus
	- we apply our principles

* Agile
	'This work is highly unknown, ambiguous, full of risk,
	 constantly changing'
		WE need a special type of team...

	Agile:	a mindset

	This is how humans think and act:
		- we collect values.
		- we use those values to shape principles.
		- our principles shape our behaviors (actions).
		"Atomic Habits", James Clear


	Scrum:	a framework (set of tools)

	WE use scrum framework ("tools")     (p.  101,  Agile PG)
	with an agile mindset  ('attitude')  (p. 8, Agile  PG)

* Agile Manifesto (why?)
	(p.  8, Agile PG)

* Principles behind the Manifesto

* Agile - Adaptive Approaches
	Adaptive: "self-organizing"

* Tailor Projects

	The Body of Knowledge is not rules.
		good practice:
		"Through analysis and practice, we've found good ways
		 of doing things. If you do them this way, you get benefits."

	It is intended to be 'modified'
		- Organizations have their own way of doing things
		- business requirements drive projects to behave
			in a certain way
		- team, expert and general human behavior shape things too.

	PMBOK: a 'standard'
		"we found out over the last century a few really good
		 ways of doing this work. If you do it this way,
		 you'll get better results."

	Tailor:
	
Tailoring (p. 131, Guide to PMBOK)
	The deliberate adaptation
	of approach,
	to make them more suitable
	for the given environment and work at handz
* Tailoring approaches:
	Predictive methods:
		we'll tailor around the team
	Adaptive methods:
		we'll tailor around the relationships
	Hybrid:
		we'll associate our tailoring based on	
		the various different needs within both
		predictive and adaptive  work.

Strategic Alignment (sl. 23)
- Vision: 	the city on the top of the hill
		"future, with imagination / vision"

- Mission:	how we will get there and build that city
		vocation, or "calling" (what we must do)

Objective:	the 'purpose' for that city
		a "good" or a thing we use to aim.
		We need to see all the farms and villages,
		to watch for weather and bad characters.

Key Results:	how we'll measure our success in that mission
			- creating 20 KM road every day
			- getting one more house up on the hill

	PM's role:
	it depends
		- within a functional organization,
		- within a project-focused organization,

* Talent Triangle
	(p. 58, Process Group PG)

	Ways of Working (WoW):
	Methods, Life Cycles,
	other "ways of getting the job done"

	Examples: Adaptive, Predictive
	Systems Thinking - a way of making sense of the complexity by looking
	at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than splitting it
	into its parts.

* Strategic Alignment and Business Skills
* Strategic Elements and Frameworks
* Organizational Influences  (pl. 38, Process Group PG)

	EEFs	- business requirements		"HAVE TO HAVE/FOLLOW"
	OPAs	- organizational preferences	"DOCUMENTATION AND GOOD PRACTICE"

	Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)
	- conditions not  under control of the team
	- influence, constrain, direct project

	Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)
	- plans, documents, templates, knowledge repositories
	- specific to and  used by the performing organization

* The external Business Environment

	How do we go out and find the EEFs and OPAs?

	*) Ask questions. Executives, business analysts, key decision-makers.

Culture - shared assumptions, values, and beliefs of a group of people
          which result in characteristic behaviors. (Storti, "Understanding the
		  World's Cultures")

	the components of a group we need to follow to belong to, get value
	from that group.

* Internal Business Environmental Factors
* OPAs, EEFs

	EEFs		- we have to follow them
			- we can't change them
			- they influence our project
				"necessary"

	OPAs		- "good practice"
			- the organization has found how they want to do this work

			* If we use this, we don't have to come up with these
			  steps and actions

			1) They make planning very easy
			2) They bring a higher probability of success
				* not necessary
				* yet can be highly beneficial

* Activity (EEFs, OPAs)

	Historical society building regulations.
	Regulation - official, authoritative rule created by government/authority
	to control, govern conduct.

	Policy:	"Tie down data cables to the framework so they don't get all tangled."
		You may fail inspection, but no fines, other severe actions."

		Regulations, laws: include fines.

	Regulation may not be as severe as a law, but...

		"When you're building a commercial building and make a hole in
		a wall to pass cables, you must fill it in with smoke-stopping putty."

	Laws, regulations contain that "necessary" component.

Approved vendor and contractors list
	1) tells us how to do something (get vendors in without
		full bidding process)
	2) Finance, legal and purchasing say "You have to use these
		vendors or at least consider them first."

	* An EEF first
	* Also can be considered an OPA.

	On the exam: mark this down as EEF (considering 1 choice)
		That is the more important role this plays.
			"Necessary"

Tenant selection process
	1) The federal government says "you must be fair"
		EEF
	2) This tells you how to select tenants
		OPA

	On the exam: mark this down as EEF (considering 1 choice)
		That is the more important role this plays.
			"Necessary"

	Take this to the exam:
		when it seems to be both EEF and OPA, 
		consider it as an EEF first (higher priority)

Policy: course or principle of action adopted or proposed by a government, business,
	individual


Project Benefits & Value (sl. 33)

	Benefit: an advantage or profit gained from something
		(we'll look at examples)

	Value:   something held in high regard
		(we'll look at examples)

		I want it. I  desire it.
		I'm willing to sacrifice for it.

* Business Value
	Net		Total, sum
	Quantifiable	I can measure it - SMART
			S pecific
			M easurable
			A chievable
			R ealistic
			T imely  / timebound
	Benefit		Advantage, profit

	tangible: it has physical presence
		"We will save 20% on energy bills year over year."

	Intangible: it may not have physical presence
		"Community good will" (the community will like us
		more if we do this)

* Examine Business Value
	We  can also use  our relationships:
	-  Sponsor
	-  Product owner
	-  Decision-makers, executives
	- experts, team, other stakeholders

		It's not 'our'  project.  It's not "my" project.
		I am merely the servant, steward (remember the principles)

* Types of Business Value
	Regularization:
		Alignment with regulations:
		HIPPA
		SoX
		OSHA
		GAAP	<- both regulations and LAWS

	We are making changes to ensure these regulations are addressed better.
		(we value this)

* Needs Assessment

		Way before a  project is even an idea,

		Business needs to make a decision:
		'We have a problem...'
		'We need a change...'
		'We have an *opportunity*...'
		"We need to invest time, money, resources in doing something new..."

	Constraint		a limiting factor

	Assumption:		a  planning factor
				considered to  be real, true, certain
				without proof
				a  'guess'
				We only use this when we don't have anything better.
				we log these and replace them when we do have better
					information.

	Risk:			Might occur (less than 100% probability)
				IF it does
				Will impact
						Probability, impact

* Business Documents
	Business Case
		Economic:Study of production, consumption,  of wealth
		What I want,  and what you want, and  how we can exchange
		to create greater value

		Feasibility: 	Can we really do this? Should  we?
				Can the organization or corporation get
				behind  us and support it.

		Feasible:	We can pull it off.
		Practical:	We can do it easily, or we should  do it.

		* Justifies the reason for setting aside money, time and resources
			to make this change, to solve this problem, to do this research.

	Business case 	justifies the reason for the organization/corporation
			to set aside money, time, resources

	Project Charter	justifies the reason to select *THIS* project
			as the solution to the business need (from needs analysis)

	Plan <==>  "How we will..."

	Benefits Management Plan
		- How we will
		* define				(using financial analysis)
		* create,  maximize  and sustain	(using positive change and
								good decision-making)
		* the benefits

* Benefit Measurement Methods
	This conversation requires functions and math.
		Don't focus on the formulas.
		Focus on:	"What does this mean?" (interpretation)
				"How do I use this to make project  decisions?" (what do you do	
				next, first? What do you not do?")

		There will be 10-11 math problems. They'll be  simple algebra

	Payback, break-even...

		Every project  costs.
		In order for a project to be selected,
		It must generate enough value to recover  cost.
		Benefits=cost	-> "break  even"
			1) we want to know when we transition from
			cost recovery to profitability
			2) we want this time to be short
				~ 18 months for IT projects
				~ 15-30 years for buildings, factories

		Payback
			The time  or milestone
			when we  achieve "break even"

			If we are a toy manufacturer:
			"When we will have sold our 10,000th plastic toy duck..."

		When we recover cost, any other  benefit = PROFIT
		(extra money we have created -> MORE VALUE)

	Opportunity cost
	*) "You can only spend money once."

		You have to choose:
			go to a movie
			go to dinner

		If you go to a movie, you miss out on a good meal
		If you go to dinner,  you miss out on entertainment

		Opportunity cost  = the  value  of  the "missed  opportunity"
			The benefit of the option you did not select.

	Project		Benefit
	A		$45,000
	B		$65,000	<- we choose the larger

			We are missing out on the benefit of A
			Opportunity cost = $45,000
			And. that. is all right.
			B's benefit is  greater than the opportunity cost.

	Project		Benefit
	A		$45,000
	B		$65,000	<- we still choose the biggest (we want biggest benefits)
	C		$25,000

		3 options
		You can ONLY CHOOSE ONE. <- you can't choose 2 or 3.
		What is the opportunity cost?

			45,000
			70,000
			20,000
			?

		The benefit  we choose will still be B.
		The cost  of  that  opportunity is
		the  missed benefit of A <- $45,000

		Why is it only $45,000?

		Even if  we had not selected  B, 
		we would have ONLY selected A and still not selected C.

		Opportunity cost is the value of the missed  opportunity
		of  next greatest  value.

	When you have  options, you will  always sacrifice.
		1) you can only choose  1
		2) by saying 'Yes'  you are also saying "No"
			This is a major concept.

		Both in business and our personal lives:
			You can only spend once - money, time, resources.


	These are not the whole picture.
	These are fundamentals
	We're in an airplane above the clouds looking at the landscape.
	In lessons 2,3 we are closer to the ground and can see buildings and cars.

		These are the building blocks we'll put together to
		talk about the "buildings and cars"

* Project Selection (PV, NPV)

	Present  Value	-> "today's" value
	Future 	 Value  -> "tomorrow's" value

	Project		Benefit
	A		$45,000
	B		$65,000

	How do I select? Choose the greater value.
		B. (we already did this.)

	NEW SCENARIO

	Project		Benefit
	A		$45,000 at the end of 3 years
	B		$65,000 at the end of 5 years

		do I go with less benefit sooner?	a
		do I go with more benefit later?	b


	We have  2 survival instincts now:
		1) "I want my money now."	<- primary survival  instinct

		sooner is not the real question.

		2) "Is it worth waiting 2  extra
			years for an extra $20,000?"
			(time value of money / TVM)

		This second  factor  takes into considering  our  rational mind.
		That's where we need  to focus.


		We will look at the math later, but this is the concept.

	We  understand stocks and investing...
		I have a present  value  that  I use to buy stocks
		I am given an investment rate  to determine
		a future value.

		each stock has a forecasted investment rate
		that helps us to move PV investments to FV returns.

	This works in reverse  (I love finance)

	You can take a future  value (3 years or 5  years)
		And by using a DISCOUNT rate
		Determine the present ("today" value)

		If I convert 3-year value
			     5-year value

		both to today's value (PV)
		I can  now compare  them equally.

	Where do I get these  discount rates?
		Finance. They have discount rates for EVERYTHING.
			products and services gain value
			they also gain costs.
		we have to understand how to consider both.

			investment, discount rates consider both
			sides.

		Once again, I'll show you the math later, but
		this is a concept that you'll see.

		Can we convert
					a 3-year benefit for 45,000
					a 5-year benefit for 65,000?
			Yes - we convert both these benefits to "today" (PV)
			and *then* we can compare them equally.

		PV, FV discount rates are variables and concepts we
		use to balance the impact of time-value relationships
		and make better comparisons (analysis)

	"Net" Present Value  (NPV)
	Net  -->  'sum' or total
		Curious? Google "Gartner IT Chart of accounts"
			1995, this was a $5,000 document.
			Free today.
		* what categories do we collect for the data?
		* how do we calculate, "treat" that data?
		* how do we interpret the results?

	You, product  owner,  business analyst and finance get together.
	You generate a group of  assumptions:

	* This product will  have  a usable  life
	* Each year of its usable life it'll generate benefits,  costs

	1) we'll take each year's  benefits, costs
	2) we'll  bring all these to the present
	3) we'll  add up the PVs  of costs, and PVs  of benefits
	4) we'll compare.
		B>C?	:-)	Profit
		B<C?	:-(	Loss
		B=C?		Break-even

		NPV = sum(PV(benefits)) compared to sum(PV(Costs))

	Year	Benefits	Costs
	-----------------------------
	0	  ---		  xxx
	1	  xxx		   xx
	2	  xxx		   xx
	3	xxxxx		 xxxx	<- upgrade  
	4	  xxx		    x	<- obsolescence
	------------------------------


	this is not the formula, but looks somewhat...
		NPV =  Sum(PV(Costs)) compared to Sum(PV(Benefits))

	Internal rate of return	(IRR)
	My INTEREST RATE for the project
		We used Interest rate to determine PV, FV
		Now, let's see if we can forecast
		an interest (growth in value) rate.

	You, product  owner,  business analyst and finance get together.
	You generate a group of  assumptions:

	* Let's assume that in a year x (let's  say year 4) a product
	  will break even (B=C).
	* What  is the interest rate where
		- The  benefits and  costs
		  balance
		- exactly at year 4?

		What is a reasonable rate of return for an IT project?
		- generally (personal experience) 13-18% yoy.
		Investment firms, IT projects can actually have higher
		IRR (and must have higher IRRs).	26% IRR.

	"Internal" rate  of return (IRR)
	'Internal'  -> the analysis of everything included  within the decision
			AND  NOTHING ELSE

	Return on Investment  (ROI)

	"What is the size of profit relative to the size  of  Cost?"
	RoI = (Profit) / (cost) <- considering everything is in Present  value

	Understanding Profit = Benefit - Cost
	RoI                  = (Benefits  - Cost) / (cost)
	It gives us a relative size of profitability

	We can compare profitability between a project
		A:	$250,000 benefits	$100,000 cost

			(B-C) = 150k
			RoI   = 150k/100k = 1.5

		B:	$450,000 Benefits	$ 95,000 cost

			(B-C)   355k
			RoI   = 355k/95k = 3.74 (374%)

* How can we consider profit in Present Value?
	Value. Benefits.
	Profit is the evaluation of  benefits after  removing cost.

	Benefits  may not be a part of revenue.
	Benefits  may be COST  SAVINGS.

		This is confusing. 
		I need to help you understand
			- not the math
			- how to use this to make decisions

		(I'll be updating the lesson 1exercises to reflect)

* How OKRs Help Deliver Business Value
	Objective:  a  "good", something at which we aim
	Key Result: a  metric we use to demonstrate achievement

We stop on sl. 43

- What do I need to do for this class right now?
------------------------------------------------
* Start a journal, write down the topics that confuse you.

* Download, organize content you have access to. Review it
  for future reference.

* Start the self-learning content now. See if you can stay
  ahead of the slides we cover in class. Again, capture the
  topics and concepts you don't understand.

* We'll get into out-of-class assignments and practice
  questions soon enough; for now, get in a routine of 
  regularly attending and reviewing class.

====================================================

Scrum:

	How to Read
	4 Levels of Reading ("How to Read a Book", Adler)
	1 - Elementary: translate text into words.
	  How Tim reads ancient Greek. (Casual Reading)
	2 - Inspectional: basic ideas of the text
	  "Scanning" - headlines, major themes (Reading on the Internet)
	3 - Analytical: From a general idea to a good understanding
	  Study, notes, review (Starting to form opinions)
	4 - Syntopical: Comparative; many books, placed in relation
	  to each other. Construction of analysis not in any book
	
	Choose the level of reading for the purpose desired.

	How to Learn
	Bloom's Taxonomy - Cognitive (knowledge-based) domain
	6) Knowledge: I remember, recognize (facts, figures)
	5) Comprehension: I demonstrate understanding
	4) Application: Using acquired knowledge (connecting relationships)
	3) Analysis: Breaking down into component parts
	2) Synthesis: Building a structure / pattern from components
	1) Evaluation: Presenting and defending opinions by making
	   judgments about information

	* The exam tests you on level 4
	* Focusing on 4,3,2 meets 6, 5

	False assumption: "I need to understand something to 100% before
	I can move forward."
	
	Correct assumption: "I'll learn to about 60-70%, and use that
	as a practice structure."


	How to Prepare
	Phase 1 - This class. Follow the discussion, capture what you don't
	understand. Phrase your question to determine what you need. Look 
	for references in context. Aim to understand to 60-70%.

	Phase 2 - Practice. Use practice questions, understand how to decompose,
	look for relationships. Study (research) concepts unclear - questions
	you don't understand. Track ratio of questions wrong per category. Focus
	on the concepts you get wrong more often. Use the Exam Content Outline
	to organize the concepts. Aim for 80-85%. Take the problems slowly.
	Work on about 20-50 questions per day.

	Phase 3 - When consistently scoring 80-85%, schedule your exam. Schedule
	it out 2-3 weeks. Continue daily practice. Retain consistent 80-85%.
	Turn attention to -
		* Focus: You will be distracted. Get comfortable with getting
		back on track.

		* Time management: start accelerating your problem-solving,
		without impacting your score.

		* Confidence: Reflect on your progress. "Observing the results
		of your efforts, demonstrating you are attaining command of
		the knowledge and mindset."

*****

From:	Lesson 1, sl.  43 Incremental Value Delivery (org culture & change)
To:	Lesson 2, sl.  21 Communication Model

* Incremental Value Delivery(p.  246,  process group  PG)

	Product owner:	"I just got  back from business -  we've decided on our
			next product...

			* We'll first  launch a basic  smartphone. We'll get it out
			  early for  quick  feedback and visibility.
			* We'll then launch the phone with better  memory.
			* We'll then launch the  phone with a better camera.
			* We'll then launch the phone with lots of  apps.

* Exam Content Outline (ECO) Coverage

Organizational Culture and Change Management (45)
	Culture: 	'the unwritten rules and laws that guide  a group'	
			* We go out to the patio every 2 pm and talk about
			  everything EXCEPT work...

			"The customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits
			 of a racial, religious, or social (ex. WORK) group.

			 The set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices
			 that characterize an organization."

			* We have a break-room everyone uses.
			* We are  committed to the corporate  vision
			* We have our own 'way' of  performing projects

	Change:		the reason for a project
			
			'Change is not bad.
			 UNCONTROLLED change is bad, and can  lead to  project  failure.'

	Traditional:	We'll have a formal change control system  that runs
			beside the project work

	Adaptive:	Change  and  change management will be  built into
			our tools and framework ("part of  the work")

* Change Management
	Projects  (And companies and all human groups)
	2  choices:
	1) let's manage change
	2) let's not manage  change

		which one has a higher  potential for  increasing value?
		which one has  a higher potential for inviting chaos  (and  failure)?

	*) We  approve "NECESSARY" changes
	*) We  reject  "UNNECESSARY" changes

		Necessary:	'it increases probability of success
				 it minimizes probability of failure.'

* Manage Organizational Change Impacts on Projects
* Get to Know Organizational Cultures and Styles
* Risk, Culture and Change in Organizations
* Change Management Framework
* Actions to Support Change
* Plan for Change

	Change MUST be formal
		Traditional: we MUST have a formal approach to managing change
			(system, integrated)

		Adaptive: we MUST build change and change management into
			the way the work is performed...
			What does this mean?
			Lesson 2 tells...

but  change creates discomfort to some team members. 
	Human behavior - change is uncertain, it is  unknowing
			it might not be in the direction I want

	Think about learning the PM Framework in this class.

* Organizational Transformation for Project Practitioners

		Objective: 	the 'destination' of a project
			26% reduction in power use
			more transactions per minute...
			etc.

		- A North star isn't a destination
		- It's a reference  point we use to correct our course.

		"Our vision is..."
			Project 'Build a Dam'
			Objective is to retain water in a lake  so we have
			a lot of water during droughts
				Destination, results

		Vision, or North Star:
			We  see a  future
			* our descendants will not lack for water ever again.

			This is not  our destination.
			We use this as a 'north star'

Project Governance (55)

Governance
	Act or process of overseeing control and direction
	of something.
		Authorizations, approvals
		signatures, sign-offs.
	
	"Decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem
	 that leads to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of social
	 norms and institutions."

* Project Governance
	Optimal
		* The  benefits  of  governance - staying on track and focused.
		* equal the costs of governance - time and effort invested.

* Governance in Adaptive Projects

	- If the work can't be well-defined
	- the environment and the relationships must  remain defined
	- and  governance integrated into these  components

* Governance Board
	Boards and committees

	Governance board 	->  "change control board"
	they make decisions.  Usually made of experts.

	Steering  committee	-> "advisory board"
	They give advice.     Usually made of experts.


* Governance Defines Escalation Procedures
	Your sponsor, product owner, executives,  senior decision-makers
	will assist you in  defining escalation.
* Governance and Life Cycles

	Project Life Cycle:	the life a project progresses through
				from its  approval
				to its final transition

	Product  life cycle:	the life a product progresses through
				from  the creation of the product as an idea
				to its final  obsolescence (total loss of value)

	A product life cycle
		can  contain many
	  project life cycles

* Phase Gates and Iterations

Phase
	A collection of logically related project activities
	That culminates in the completion of one or more
	deliverables.

		Ex.	"Build a Restaurant"
			--------------------
			* Landscape		<- logically related collection
			* building		<- results in the completion
			* Kitchen		   of one/more deliverable/s.
			* dining area
			* bar
			* menus
			* staff

				a phase gate in this project.
				We end the building phase, and want to start
					kitchen, dining, bar phases.
					We apply governance.
					"Is the building finished enough for
					 us to focus on the individual phases?"
	
Gate	An entry/exit point between items
	fields and pastures
	territories
	phases

	A "good  place  to apply control"
	- Are we ready to continue?
	- Are we done?
	- What's the progress, status?

Waterfall (Predictive approach)

	- A type of predictive: Sequential phases, where the finish of one leads
	  to the start of the next.

	- "Even though the approach is rigid and not necessarily cost-effective,
	   it is still used and required on several types of projects, especially
	   those with clear requirements that are unlikely to change..."
	   (p. 85, "Project Management" 13th ed., Kerzner)

Releases
	Multiple transitions of deliverable

Iterations
	"Repeats";  opportunities to demonstrate  functionality and  value
	in exchange for feedback

* Project Phases
* Apply Governance to Predictive Project Phases

sl. 62  
Project Compliance (67)

-Compliance
The state of meeting—or being in accord with—organizational, 
legal, certification or other relevant regulations.

	A form of governance that confirms:
	"We are following process, procedure."
	
* Compliance Requirements
* Compliance Categories Classification
* Compliance Threats
	What if an organization does not have a stated quality
	plan? How do you apply quality on your project.

	Threat	a type of  risk  - it's "negative"
	Compliance activities need to be transparent.

	* if we're not informed, we see compliance as a checklist.
	* if we are informed, we learn that compliance protects the
		company from loss of face, and  potential cost into 10s  of Millions USD.

	When planning  compliance activities,
	Please identify at least 1  risk surrounding that  compliance:
	"What if  we don't get that signature?
	 What if  we aren't in compliance?
	 What if the worst possible outcome occurs?"
		- someone gets hurt
		- we create defects
		- the company loses extreme face (data breaches)

	Compliance states: "we  approve the fact we  are  following process and procedure."
	* We're following the process of our project  (the "plan")
	* We're following the process of our  organization.
	* We're  following process of our corporation
	* We're following process of the government (laws, regulations)

	Risk: something  that
		* MIGHT happen
		* if it does, WILL impact (often negatively)

	We need to  identify these potential outcomes of  not  being compliant.

		1) it ensures we're taking compliance seriously
		2) it's a  great communication tool to ensure
			the organization and company trusts  us.


====================================================
Lesson 2
Start the Project

Identify and Engage Stakeholders (03)
* Typical Project Stakeholders

		- individual,  group, entity (like "government")
		* Might impact a project
		* Might be impacted by a project
		* Might perceive  themselves to be impacted

	Stakeholder
		- individual,  group, entity (like "government")
		* Might impact a project
			pm, team, sponsor, product owner,  decision-makers, executives

			We're running a  critical task in the lab. A  janitor cleans
			the lab every night.
			A  stakeholder?

			We are responsible  for
			* identifying them
			* assessing their potential impact
			* ensuring
				we minimize negative impact
				we maximize positive impact

			"The whole world" is not a stakeholder.
			We have to determine the greater body of stakeholders
			that will ensure success.


		* Might be impacted by a project
			users of the product being developed
			recipients of the result of the project's service

		Ex. Your project is upgrading corporate email. This will change
			everything in how we manage our  messages.
			It will slow down  admins  especially since everyone
			will go  to them for questions.

			Is an admin a stakeholder on this project?
			* if we don't get them on our side, they can hurt our project  severely.

			A  stakeholder?

			We are responsible  for
			* identifying them
			* assessing their potential impact
			* ensuring
				we minimize negative impact
				we maximize positive impact

		* Might perceive  themselves to be impacted
			they "THINK" they'll be impacted.

			Information Technology (IT) thinks our  project 
			will eliminate  their jobs.
			They're  wrong.

			Are they stakeholders?

			Yes.

			The  IT department can raise such a ruckus that
			it disrupts and may even stop our project.

			We are responsible  for
			* identifying them
			* assessing their potential impact
			* ensuring
				we minimize negative impact
				we maximize positive impact

	- You will NEVER identify enough stakeholders
	- you will sometimes miss the critical ones.
	- The best approach:
		start identifying stakeholders as soon as you are assigned,
		and continue to identify, assess, and determine how to engage...

			Engage - "involve"
			in order to minimize negative  impact
			in order  to maximize positive impact

	"A watchman who is gatekeeper to a data center is a stakeholder for the company?"
		If that watchman can  either help or hurt my project, I have to consider
		them as a stakeholder
		- identify
		- assess
		- determine appropriate engagement

	In the past, my students have  said, give me a list so I can capture everyone.
	Any list  will not include all  your project's potential stakeholders

	instead of a list, focus on a process or system...

		Using the definition of stakeholders, hold that as a lens
		against everyone that seems to be in and around your project.

* Stakeholder and Communications Management

	We attempt to engage all stakeholders
	- our primary mode of engagement: "sharing information 2  ways"
						(communications)
		Engagement <=>  'Involvement'

	Stakeholder register
		- a project  document
		* contains stakeholders and contact information
		* as  well as any  information we need to determine
		  how they should be engaged.

	Stakeholder engagement plan
	- how we  will
	* identify, assess, and engage
	* our stakeholders

	Communication management plan
	- how we  will
	* plan
	* "do"
	* monitor (and change appropriately)
	* communications  ('sharing information 2  ways')

	Stakeholder engagement assessment  matrix
	a tool we use to determine appropriate stakeholder engagement
		- based on our identification
		- using simple assessment

* Stakeholder Identification
	Interest: one stakeholder characteristic:
	'curiosity'
		This is a human super-power
		that allowed us to turn groups of  villages
		into mighty emprise.

	If someone is curious, nothing will stop them from learning that information.
		Give them information for which they'r ecurious, they become satisfied.
	(motivation)

* Assess Stakeholders
	(p. 23, process group PG)

	Data		raw, without context
			"We spent $5,000 last week."
			Is this bad, good? We don't know - it's only data.

	Information	Data, in context
			"We are now $400 over budget."
			This is bad - we  can determine that.

	Reports		- graphical representations of information
			- intended to drive control:
				analysis, review, decisions, governance,
				compliance...

	Analysis: is how we turn data into information
	Reports:  are what we use to control the project.

Brainstorming
Identify a list of ideas in a short amount of time.
Conducted in a group environment, led by a facilitator.

	Capturing the data
	not necessarily turning it into information.

* Create the Stakeholder Register
	Includes
	- identification
	- analysis
	- CLASSIFICATION
		organization of my stakeholders in groups
		such that I can determine how to engage

	Expectation:	an opinion considered to be so common sense
			it doesn't need to be shared.

	Perception:	how we 'see  things'
			shaped  by
			our opinions
			habits, behaviors
			principles, values

* Stakeholder Characteristics
	Level of authority: Power
	the 'energy' required to exert influence
	
	Interest: curiosity  - a major driver of human behavior

	influence/impact: ability to make changes through the actions of others

* Salience

Salience -  Notable,  noticeable, prominent  - I can see it easily.

Salience Model
A classification model that groups stakeholders according to level of authority,
immediate needs, and how appropriate their involvement is in terms of the project.

* level of authority			POWER
* immediate needs			URGENCY
* how appropriate their involvement is 	AUTHENTICITY, "LEGITIMACY"

* Plan Stakeholder Communications

	Communications: sharing information 2 ways
				intentionally, unintentionally

	90% of our activity:
			'planning, doing and  "ensuring"
			project communications

			Ensuring:	monitoring  communications and making appropriate changes

	We share  information that's APPROPRIATE

		If others perceive we're hiding information, they'll no longer  trust us.
		WE have to adopt a  general approach
			* transparency
			* without over-sharing

			a  wicked,  wicked balance to achive


* Communication Requirements Analysis
* Communication: Methods and Technologies
		Oral, written:
		When do we share information using documents?
			1) validation - did they actually agree in that meeting?
			2) were they part of conversations?
			3) version control: control the document, control
			   version of the information.

	Push communications:	I send  information out.
				emails. Distribution lists.
				document distribution
				meetings

				when sharing information quickly, the
				sender can determine urgency.

	Pull communications:	I keep information updated
				in a centralized location
				in order for you to access
				whenever you need.

				Shared folders
				Information radiators
				Dashboards

	Interactive:		a combination of push, pull
				in order to gain  project success
				(to meet all communication needs)

* Communication Methods
* Communication Challenges/Considerations

	Tools:  ease of use - 'transparency'
		Are the tools almost  invisible?

		Am I spending more time  in managing and using the tools
		than getting the work done?

* Communication Model
	model	- a simple example
		- used to demonstrate  a small set of  functions/results

	1) understand  "acknowledge", acknowledgement
		- I received the message and decoded  it
		- I understand what to do with the information

		The sender  must retain control of acknowledgement
		I can't just rely on you telling me you acknowledge.
		I can't assume that no acknowledgement means  you understand.

		Communications failure of any kind rest on the shoulders of the PM.

	2) understand  "noise"
		ANYTHING
		* that  gets in the way of receiving the message
				loud  machines in the room
				too much distance between  sender,  receiver

		* that gets in the way  of decoding the message
				I'm tired, I'm hungry,  I'm distracted,
				I have high emotions

				When's lunch?  Will I get off in time
				to have  dinner  with my family?
				I'm almost out of  gas...
				I feel sick...
				I'm worried...

* Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

	"Levels" of engagement

Future Scrum Topics
	* What about the PMBOK? Which version?
		Are there other guides I need?
	* How do I get the PMBOK  for Free?
	- How to Read
	- How to Learn
	- How to Prepare
	- What is a practice question, and how do I use it?
	- How can a PM take advantage of AI NOW?
	- How is AI prepared to impact our careers the next 2 decades.
	- Where can I find lots of practice questions?
	- What PMI materials do I have to prepare? (after the classes are over)
	- PM Careers for the next 30-40  years.
	- What does recertification look like?

(Our next Scrum - Saturday + "how to read a book", "How to learn")

Maybe post-session
- Are there really good books for PMs (continuous education)

Questions unanswered

* What sources do we need to prepare
	(this is already part of "how to prepare")

* How are the standards created, evaluated?
	Universities come to PMI for accreditation.
	PMI manages one standard of PM
		that aligns with
		ISO 21500
		Many ANSI standards.

* 	(Tim) define tailoring, define adaptive, and compare.
	relationship between tailoring and adaptive methods?
	adaptive promotes active, constant change (for clarification and greater
							benefits/value)

	tailoring: a "change" based on preference beyond mere good practice.

* Dear Tim, Is there any notes which filtered topics by you was available?? 
  To revise for upcoming sessions
	There are aspects in place, but they are inferred.
	(Tim) think about some proactive preparation before the next topics.
		Forecasted general topics for 1 day, 1 week.

	This is heading to a whole workbook that is actually something
	you can read and not just publish.
		I just sent my 1st book to the publisher.
		The next book is just this. It'll take 1 year to create
		the content and about 4 months to prepare it for print.

* Whether Mission changes on every year?
	business and strategic planning concepts

* When do we get to exercises? Can we do exercises along the various topics?
	maybe.

	I have exercises by lesson.
	I have a sheet for our last class that takes about 2 hours.

* why don't we have our notes in cloud to get updates and for reference
	I tried this. I tried many different cloud services.
	This becomes un-manageable.
	This was moved by Simplilearn into the LMS to protect it
	from cloud links getting out.
	We used slack - the links got out.
	We used to have a forum. The links got out.


*  adaptive management when resources are trying to manage both program and projects vs ongoing operations?
	There are attempts to take greater advantage of adaptive methods in bus; 
	- we are right now looking at uncertainty in general and preparing
	  business and people for major change.

* when hiring a consultant company, it becomes quiet problamatic wherein the resource which are the best are on other projects and thus newly hired are deployed within the project and therefore the company is charged the same but does not obtain same quality of the product. How to deal with it?

* Tim- EEF are static and have to have follow (out of our circle of influence). On other hand OPA can be changed or continuous improved with the time & requirement. (under our control).  Am I understanding both correctly?. 
	- Sometimes, EEFs change A LOT.

* if there was a selection criteria to select vendors or criteria list then it would have been OPA but now the resource or vendor is approved or the list of vendor decided and constrained, then it will be EFF

* so for clarity:  if it is demanded by a higher authority than the PM or the project,  
  it is an eef?
	EEF: generally outside of control of the team/project/PM
		may be organizational,
		may even be outside of corporation

	HAS to be part of the project.

	OPA: good practice, not REQUIRED, yet potentially provides benefits
		we may elect to choose these

* "the O in OPA stands for Organizational:  anything not created by organization (or adopted)  are External"
		Think of it at a higher level.
		Organizational *process assets"
			- these are documented information
			  that tell us how to do things well.
		NOT NECESSARY

	EEFS	*are* necessary
		- they may be external
		- they also may be internal
			(finance, contracting, purchasing policies and regulations)

* Policy: course or principle of action adopted or proposed by a government, business,
	individual

* Thanks tim for explaining th case study of Telescope, however what about the business case when so many astronomy clubs or classes were created or these societies wherein prerequisite to enter them was buying these telescopes?

Rather than targeting these children, you end up targeting children clubs/societies?
	This is a business discussion, but very important.
	In planning, we'll revisit when we discuss
	"User centered design" (Who is our "real" or *final* customer?)

Rather than targeting these children, you end up targeting children clubs/scoieties?
* so what your saying is : we have to be able to read/interpret the reports, make the correct decision about what the number is telling us, and come the the best conclusion about how to act based on the report?
	That's exactly right. (the best type of right)

* so for clarity:  If ROI is over 0 = good  under 0 = bad?
		Profit / Cost	these equal	1.0, 100%
				P < C		< 1
				P > C		> 1

		Benefits to cost	when these are equal -> breakeven
		RoI			> 1			Profitability that is accepted

* How do i get a pdf copy of slides?
* What is the origin for these methodologies??

Questions requiring review

* (Tim) More detail please on Organizational PM:
		- Organizational Project Management (p. 12, Process Group PG)
* (Tim) Please provide definitions of:
	- Project Life Cycle
	- Project Phase
	- Phase Gate
	- PM Process
	- PM Process Group
	(p. 13, process gropu PG)
* What's the difference between a customer and an end user? (p. 13, PMBOK / section 1)
* (Tim) Do we have a PM on adaptive projects?
	Does an adaptive project *need* a PM?
* (Tim) develop an OPM example (an organization that strategically
		uses projects, programs, portfolios)

Answered questions

* In adaptive project management approaches, is it necessary for a single individual to oversee and monitor the project throughout the entire life cycle, or can proper execution and planning be ensured through collaborative monitoring and iterative processes?
	- Both Predictive and Adaptive Projects can treat PM as a group
	  of tasks (a "role") where the tasks are distributed.
	- If a distributed model is employed, the role of PM has to be
	  very integrated, i.e. communication must be very effective for
	  each component to relate to the others - i.e. finance, schedule and
	  scope, contracting, etc.

I asked it because, even though we were following agile project management for several projects, there was always a responsible individual overseeing throughout the life cycle.
	- Traditionally, PM is seen to have one single individual in charge (one
	  single point of contact). The distributed PM model has been seen to be more
	  effective, especially in less formal PM environments, where the budget
	  might be entirely indirect, or purchasing and contracts are not part
	  of the project.
	- Also, consider the technology - quality may be critical, or risk management
	  or change management may be critical (for example). In these instances,
	  formality is delegated to experts, or organizations that either do this
	  for the organization / other organizations, or even contracted in.

* can you kindly share your email id at the end of the class? wherein we can ask you questions directly by email?
	- I Considered this when starting remote training; this opened me up to additional
	  5-100 conversations per month; today it would destroy my email box.

	- If you want to stay in touch and see what I'm working on in public,
	  feel free to look me up in social media.

	- I prioritize my students when they are in my classes; after this,
	  I answer questions, give guidance, etc.

* What's a composite organizational structure?
	"Many organizational structures include strategic, middle management,
	 and operational levels. The PM may interact with all 3 levels."

	- (P. 46, Process Group PG)

* I have multiple projects  one is building a KB for PMP  one is building a KB for Computer science: they don't really relate to each other but work towards my strategic initiative to gain knowledge to make me employable .  these two are part of my portfolio.

	- Think about this:

		Portfolio: The organizational strategy
		Program:   "Extra" benefits, relating to the group of projects
		Project:   Deliverable (product, service, result)

	For your example, your portfolio supports employability ("make sure my work
	generates pay."). Call it "Keep Me Employed".

	The two builds are projects, they are focused on creating something or
	making a change.

	A program would be putting in categories, such as "KB projects", "User
	interface projects", "graphics projects".

	It would be totally appropriate, with how you structure your work, that
	you organize this as "2 projects, that are part of 1 portfolio."

* WhatsApp
	- its great for people preparing to group together.
	- we can't talk about it in this session (it's recorded)
		* if you share personal information in this class
		* it's recorded and gets out of control of the students and Simplileanr
		* Simplilearn already made a promise to protect your personal information
		* we must establish a policy that says "find a way to share personal
		  information outside of class."

I have lots of open questions. If I don't answer them post-session,
I'll start answering them outside of class and leave the answers in the notes.
I can even carry some questions into the forum (you can too if you need to)

* Please demonstrate PMI training content access
	We completed! Right after break
	how to get to content
	what content consists of


* Can Scrum Master Experience for a Agile Project can be considered for 
  PM experience criteria of 36 Months?
	We have to understand
		- what a PM does
		- what a scrum master does
		- do they overlap?
	* Scrum master: makes sure scrum works and is effective
	* PM? What about budget? What about contracts? What about
		risk and quality? <- the material you'll use for
			your project documentation (refer to EXam content outline)

* If same project can be executed by two different Project Manager.
  both way by different people as I same kind of project...?
	Let's step away from thinking of PM as a job title or assignment.
 	Let's start thinking of PM as a group of tasks ("role")
		role: a group of tasks
			performed by 1 or more individual, group, entity

		1 role can be filled by multiple people
		1 person can take on more than 1 role

* whne using an example lets stick with it instead of jumping cause i still dont know is germany and the uk under the same program or would we seperate it?
	It's like designing scope.
		We can design a work breakdown on any project in any of
		1,000 ways. I'm using a single example to demonstrate the concept
		and application, we can discuss other specific examples
		if time allows.

* for the sake of time, can we reserve the questions for after the session, 
this is my suggestion. A *great* suggestion.
	- I am daily monitoring remaining time and will balance questions
	  to completing content daily.

* You can take note by computer, but this sometimes side-steps
	comprehension.

  It seems, writing by hand engages the mind in the concepts behind
	the symbols.

	I write the greater body of notes for you.
	You write the outline, and the questions where you
	have doubt.

* Why won't TIm share his pdfs?
	*) PMI and Simplilearn and I are in an agreement:
		- pdfs are for students who purchased.
		- ppts are for trainers.
	*) PMI published materials are for people who purchased

	Finally - I teach ethics as well as PM. If I teach ethics
	and don't practice ethics, how do I ensure you understand
	the value of them?

		AND - if it's ethics that I have no integrity,
		how can you believe me in anything?

	I have made this decision as a trainer; you all will make
	your own ethical decisions.

* How do I know what to document (and how to document it)?
	- is the work I did a project?
	- What is the work I did leading and managing?

* Reaching support:

	"contact us" (bottom)
	look for a local ph. number (no ph. charges)
	use the calling tree to find a human
