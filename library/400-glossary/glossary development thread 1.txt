Acceptance (risk response),gloss-acceptance-risk,A,"We document acceptance and keep a small contingency in reserve.","Acceptance means we choose to live with a risk, document it, and (for active acceptance) set aside contingency instead of taking preventive action now.","If treatment costs outweigh likely impact, acceptance is reasonable.

Acceptance criteria,gloss-acceptance-criteria,A,"We won’t call the job done until the acceptance criteria are met.","Acceptance criteria are the specific, testable conditions that must be met before a deliverable is approved by the customer or sponsor.","On questions about 'done,' pick Validate Scope using acceptance criteria.

Actual Cost (AC),gloss-actual-cost,A,"Actual Cost (AC) jumps this sprint after the rush license.","Actual Cost (AC) is the amount of money the project actually spent on the work completed during the period you’re measuring.","Remember CPI = EV ÷ AC and CV = EV − AC. Rising AC without EV growth lowers CPI and makes CV more negative. If asked 'spent so far,' AC is the number—not PV or EV.",[[pmp/200-process/240-cost]],draft,Y
Acquire resources (process),gloss-acquire-resources,A,"We acquire resources later than planned and adjust the calendar.","Acquire Resources is the process of getting the people, equipment, and materials the project needs to perform the work.","Outputs include resource assignments and calendars.
